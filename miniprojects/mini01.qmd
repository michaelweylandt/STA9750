## Welcome to {{< var course.short >}} Mini Projects!

In the {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects, you will perform basic data
analyses intended to model best practices for your course final project.
(Note, however, that these are *mini*-projects; your final course project is
expected to be far more extensive than any single MP.)

For purposes of MPs, we are dividing the basic data analytic workflow into
several major stages:

-  Data Ingest and Cleaning: Given a single data source, read it into `R` and
   transform it to a reasonably useful standardized format.
-  Data Combination and Alignment: Combine multiple data sources to enable
   insights not possible from a single source.
-  Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Take a data table and compute informative
   summary statistics from both the entire population and relevant subgroups
-  Data Visualization: Generate insightful data visualizations to spur insights
   not attainable from point statistics
-  Inferential Statistical Analysis and Modeling: Develop relevant predictive
   models and statistical analyses to generate insights about the *underlying
   population* and not simply the data at hand.

In this course, our primary focus is on the first four stages: you will take
other courses that develop analytical and modeling techniques for a variety of
data types. As we progress through the course, you will eventually be
responsible for the first four steps. Specifically, you are responsible for the
following stages of each mini-project:

+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+

: Students' Responsibilities in Mini-Project Analyses {.hover}

In early stages of the course, such as this MP, I will 'scaffold' much of the
analysis for you, leaving only those stages we have discussed in class for you
to fill in. As the course progresses, the mini-projects will be more
self-directed and results less standardized.

### Rubric

{{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects are evaluated using *peer grading* with *meta-review* by the course GTAs. Specifically, variants of the following rubric
will be used for the mini-projects:

: Mini-Project Grading Rubric

Note that this rubric is designed with copious opportunities for extra credit if
students go *above and beyond* the instructor-provided scaffolding. Students
pursuing careers in data analytics are strongly encouraged to go beyond the strict
ambit of the mini-projects to i) further refine their skills; ii) learn additional
techniques that can be used in the final course project; and iii) develop a more
impressive professional portfolio.

Because students are encouraged to use {{< var course.short >}} mini-projects as
the basis for a professional portfolio, the basic skeleton of each project will be
released under a fairly permissive usage license. Take advantage of it!

### Submission Instructions

After completing the analysis, write up your findings, *showing all of
your code*, using a dynamic `quarto` document and post it to your course
repository. The `qmd` file should be named `{r} I(mp_file$qmd)` so the
rendered document can be found at `{r} I(mp_file$html_long)` in the student's
repository and served at the URL:[^sub]

> `https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html`

Once you confirm this website works (substituting `<GITHUB_ID>` for the actual GitHub username provided to the professor in [MP#00](./mini00.html) of course), open a new issue at

> `https://github.com/michaelweylandt/{{< var course.repo >}}/issues/new` .

Title the issue `{{< var course.short >}} <GITHUB_ID> MiniProject #{{< meta mp_num >}}` and fill in the following text for the issue:

::: {#submission-text}

```         
Hi @michaelweylandt!

I've uploaded my work for MiniProject #**{{< meta mp_num >}}** - check it out!

https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html
```

:::

Once the submission deadline passes, the instructor will tag classmates for peer feedback in this issue thread.

*Additionally*, a PDF export of this report should be submitted on Brightspace. To create a PDF from the uploaded report, simply use your browser's 'Print to PDF' functionality.

**NB**: The analysis outline below specifies key *tasks* you need to perform within your write up. Your peer evaluators will check that you complete these. You are encouraged to do extra analysis, but the bolded **Tasks** are *mandatory*.

**NB**: Your final submission should look like a *report*, not simply a list of
facts answering questions. Add introductions, conclusions, and your own commentary.
You should be practicing both raw *coding* skills and written *communication* in
all mini-projects. There is little value in data points stated without context or
motivation.

[^sub]: Throughout this section, replace `<GITHUB_ID>` with your GitHub ID from
[Mini-Project #00](./mini00.html), making sure to remove the angle brackets. Note
that the automated course infrastructure will be looking for precise formatting,
so follow these instructions closely. 

## Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}: {{< meta mp_title >}}

Congratulations! You have just been appointed as a senior technical
analyst working with New York City's new *Commission to Analyze Taxpayer
Spending* (CATS). As a technical analyst, you are tasked with helping the
Commissioners understand New York City's expenses and identifying
opportunities to spend taxyper monies more effectively. Specifically,
the Commission chair, Mr. Keno Slum, has asked you to analyze the City
payroll and to identify instances in which senior agency officials make
significantly more than rank-and-file city employees. 

In this mini-project, you will analyze City payroll data and write a 
report highlighting possible savings to be submitted to the CATS
Commissioners. In this mini-project, you will: 

1) Begin to work with [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
2) Practice Use of `dplyr` for analysis of tabular data
3) Practice Use of `quarto` and Reproducible Research Tools for Effective
   Communication of Data Analysis Results

::: {.callout-warning title="Writing Requirements"}

Recall that you are *evaluated* on writing and communication in these 
Mini-Projects. You are required write a report in the prescribed style, here
an internal policy briefing 'white paper'. A submission that performs the 
instructor-specified tasks, but does not write and give appropriate context
and commentary will score very poorly on the relevant rubric elements. 

In particular, if a submission is not in "white paper" style, peer evaluators
should judge it to have "Good" quality Written Communication (at best) as key
findings are not conveyed appropriately. 

Quarto's [cold folding](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code) 
functionality is useful for "hiding" code so that it doesn't break the flow of
your writing. 

You can also make use of [Quarto's `contents`
shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/contents.html) to present
code and findings in an order other than how the code should be executed.
This is particularly useful if you want to include a figure or table in an 
"Executive Summary" at the top of your submission.

### Acquiring Payroll Data

The following code will download the city payroll data and create a file
`nyc_payroll_export.csv` in a `data/mp01` directory. If this doesn't work
for whatever reason, you can download the data directly from [NYC
OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data), though you will need to make sure it is in a suitable
location and format for use in this mini-project.[^exportspeed]

You do not (yet) need to understand the code above, so please use the course
discussion board if you have trouble getting it working. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 1: Data Acquisition"}

Using the code above, acquire the latest NYC Payroll Data. 

:::

::: {.callout-caution title="Do Not `git add` Data Files"}

Make sure that `git` is set to ignore data files, such as the one created above.
Check the `git` pane in `RStudio` and make sure that `nyc_payroll_export.csv`
does not appear. (If you set up your `.gitignore` file correctly in
[MP#00](./mini00.html), it should already be ignored.) If it is appearing, you
may need to edit your `.gitignore` file.

Removing a large data file from `git` is possible, but difficult. Don't get
into a bad state!

:::


[^exportspeed]: For some reason, this data takes up to seven or eight minutes to
download from the city website, even though it's really not that complicated or
massive. Don't fret. 

### Importing Data into `R` and Preparing for Analysis

Before we can analyze this data, we need to get it into `R` and in a suitable
format. The `read_csv` function from the `readr` package can be used to read
`csv` files into `R` (imagine that!). The above download code will handle most
of the irregularities in the city data,[^prep] so we only need to make a few
changes before beginning our analysis. In particular, let's change some of the
string columns to more conventional punctuation. The `str_to_title` function
from the `stringr` package isn't _perfect_ (name capitalization rules can be
rather idiosyncratic), but it will get us pretty close. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 2: Data Import and Preparation"}

Read your data into `R` using the `read_csv` function from the `readr` package.
Before continuing, use a `mutate` command and the `str_to_title` function from
the `stringr` package to convert the following columns to more conventional
formatting. 

- Agency Name
- Last Name
- First Name
- Work Location (Borough)
- Title / Job Description
- Leave Status

:::

It is good practice to always visually check your data to make sure it is properly
formatting. You can use the `glimpse` function for a quick look here. We will use
more refined formatting below. 

### Initial Exploration

#### Identifying Individual Records

Any time you are analyzing a new data set, you should begin by making sure
you understand what the relevant columns are. In this case, we have basic
descriptions of each column from the [data
page](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data). We seem, however, to lack a few things you would
normally want in a data set like this: in particular, we don't have a unique
ID for employees (a "primary key" in database parlance). This will make it 
harder for us to track individuals across years or across agencies (if they
have two jobs at different agencies in the same fiscal year); we can approximate
a unique identifier with First+Middle+Last, but it won't be perfect. 

Let's begin by reviewing the career of the current mayor, **Eric L. Adams**. Use
a combination of `filter`, `rename`, `arrange` to create a table like the
following. (You may also need to use `group_by` and `summarize`.)

| Fiscal Year | Position    | Agency                    | Total Salary |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 2020        | Game Keeper | Parks and Recreation      | 15000        |
| 2021        | Fish Sorter | Environmental Protection  | 25000        |
| 2022        | Mayor       | Office of the Mayor       | 35000        |
| 2023        | Hamburgler  | McDonald's on 23rd        | 20000        |

(Obviously, these numbers and details are not correct.) Note that the Mayoral
term does not line up with the City's fiscal year, so you can choose how best
to combine years in which Mr. Adams held more than one job. Once you have
created the career table for Mr. Adams, you can use the `DT` package to create
an attractive visualization of your results. 

For example, 

```{r}
#| message: false
library(DT)
library(scales)

tbl_txt <- "
Fiscal Year, Position, Agency, Total Salary
2020,Game Keeper, Parks and Recreation, 15000
2021, Fish Sorter, Environmental Protection, 25000
2022, Mayor, Office of the Mayor, 35000
2023, Hamburgler, McDonald's on 23rd,20000"

read_csv(tbl_txt) |> 
    mutate(`Total Salary` = dollar(`Total Salary`)) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, 
                           paging=FALSE,
                           info=FALSE))
```

The [`DT` package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) wraps the 
Javascript [`datatables` library](https://datatables.net/) to
to provide interactive tables. This library has _many_ options
to control formatting. Later in this course, you will also 
counter the [`gt` package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) to create
complex tables natively in `R`.

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 3: Create an Employee Salary Table"}

Create an employee salary table for **Eric L. Adams** similar to that
shown above, but with real salary and employment records.

:::

#### Calculating Aggregate Salaries

For high-ranking officials like Mayor Adams, their total compensation is a fixed 
salary. For other NYC employees, total compensation is computed using their
hourly wage and the total hours worked (both regular and overtime). As a general
rule, overtime is paid at 1.5x premium, so an employee who worked 40 hours of
scheduled time and 20 hours of overtime with a base pay of \$25 per hour, will
be paid: 

$$ \$25 * (40 + 20 * 1.5) = \$1750 $$

Other employees are paid a "day rate" - that is, a fixed amount per day worked.
For purposes of this exercise, you can covert hours worked to days at a fixed
rate of 7.5 hours per day. That is, if an employee is paid \$100 per day and 
reports 1500 hours worked, you can estimate their pay as: 

$$ \$100 * \frac{1500}{7.5} = \$20,000 $$

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 3: Calculation of Total Compensation"}

Use these calculations to compute actual total compensation for each employee
record in our data set. You will need to use a `case_when()` function inside
a `mutate()` command to handle different pay structures. 

:::

Now that we have computed total compensation for each city employee, we are 
ready to begin our analysis of the city payroll. Before we go further, answer
some general questions about this data set to make sure you are comfortable with
it. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 4: Instructor-Provided Questions"}

Answer the following questions about city payroll data. In your final write-up,
include these in the form of a "quick facts" bullet as part of your introduction.

1. Which job title has the highest base rate of pay? (If needed, assume a 
   standard 2000 hour work year and no overtime.)
2. Which individual \& in what year had the single highest 
   city total payroll (regular and overtime combined)? 
3. Which individual worked the most overtime hours in this data set? 
4. Which agency has the highest average total annual payroll (base and overtime
   pay per employee)? 
5. Which agency has the most employees on payroll in each year? 
6. Which agency has the highest overtime usage (compared to regular hours)? 
7. What is the average salary of employees who work outside the five boroughs? 
   (That is, whose `work_location_borough` is not one of the five counties.)
8. How much has the city's aggregate payroll grown over the past 10 years?

:::

::: {.callout-caution title="Avoid Using the 'Paid' Columns"}

Our data set includes columns `regular_gross_paid`, `total_ot_paid`
and `total_other_paid` that seem like they could be used for this mini-project.
If you look closely, you will see that these amounts do not match what you
might calculate by hand. This is because these include adjustments for i) use
of deferred compensation plans; ii) pre-tax benefit withholding; iii) various
*ad hoc* adjustments negotiated as part of collective bargaining agreements. 
Understanding all of these is far beyond the scope of this project, so you should
use the simplified calculations described above.

:::

### Policy Analysis

CATS has asked you to analyze three possible policy changes to analyze their 
impact on overall spending. Your supervisor has suggested two policies and has
asked you to create a third for analysis. For each policy, 

1) compute its impact on city payroll, *i.e.*, determine how the total payroll
   expenses would have changed if that policy had been in place historically;
2) determine any other staffing adjustments required to implement that policy, 
   *e.g.*, hiring more employees; and
3) make a recommendation to the CATS commissioners on whether this policy
   should be adopted.
   
#### Policy I: Capping Salaries at Mayoral Level

Many governments require that the no subordinate employee be paid more than
the chief executive (mayor, governor, president). CATS is considering
recommending that the city adopt such a policy. To analyze it: 

1) Compute the total mayor pay for each fiscal year and identify employees who
   made more than this amount in the same fiscal year. 
2) Determine total savings if these employees' compensation were capped at the
   mayor's salary. 
3) Identify which agencies and job titles (if any) would bear the brunt of this
   policy. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 5: Analyze the Impact of Capping Salaries at Mayoral Level"}

Analyze the impact of capping total aggregate compensation for any employee at
the level of the mayor's annual salary. Make a recommendation to CATS based
on your findings. 

:::


#### Policy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses

A major driver of payroll expenditures is the "1.5x" premium associated with
overtime work. That is, it may be cheaper to hire two employees to each work
30 hours to complete a task than to hire one employee to work 40 regular hours
and 20 overtime hours to complete the same task.[^union] The CATS Commissioners
are considering urging certain city agencies to hire more employees and to reduce
the amount of overtime used.[^overtime]

Analyze the potential upside of increasing employment to reduce overtime. 

1) For each combination of agency and job title, identify the total number of
   overtime hours worked and see how many full-time employees it would take to
   replace that much overtime. 
2) For each combination of agency and job title, calculate the total savings
   possible by converting all overtime hours to regular time hours for (new
   employees). 
3) Determine the aggregate savings possible by agency. This will let the CATS
   Commission recommend the agencies where this hiring action would have the 
   largest benefit.
   
Note that much of this analysis must be done on an agency + job title basis. 
If, *e.g.*, NYPD is paying lots of overtime to Sargents, hiring additional
IT Specialists will not help. Similarly, hiring additional IT Specialists into
NYPD will not help reduce the need for IT Specialists at the NYC Housing
Authority. After completing this analysis at the agency + job title basis, 
you can aggregate (over job titles) to the agency level, as this is the most
likely level at which hiring policy adjustments can be made. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 6: Analyze the Potential Savings of Hiring Additional Employees to Reduce Overtime Expenses"}

Analyze the impact of authorizing agencies to hire more employees with the intent
to reduce overtime expenses. Make sure to report the total potential savings, 
the total number of employees needed, and the agencies and job titles where
such a change in policy would have the largest impact. The CATS Commissioners
are particularly interested in a job title analysis as it may be hard to hire
additional employees in certain positions.

:::

[^union]: A commonly-raised criticism of public sector unions, such as those
covering NYC employees, is that they make it difficult to hire additional
employees, thereby directing more overtime hours to their (current) membership.
I do not know of any reputable analysis supporting or refuting this claim in
the context of NYC, though I would be interested in reading one if you come
across one in your background reading.

[^overtime]: A [recent NYT
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/nyregion/nypd-overtime-hiring.html)
describes recent struggles of the NYPD to increase staffing and to decrease
the use of overtime pay. It's not as simple as one might hope... (As a Baruch 
student, you have a free subscription to the *New York Times*; find registration
details [here](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/current/graduate-advisement-hub/campus-resources/free-subscriptions-for-zicklin-students/).)

#### Policy III: Create Your Own Policy Proposal

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 7: Create and Analyze an Additional Policy Proposal"}

Create your own policy proposal and analyze it in the same manner as the 
previous two policies. You are encouraged to draw upon real-world proposals 
to reduce city payroll. 

:::

## Deliverable: Policy Analysis "White Paper"

Write up your findings in the form of a "white paper" to be shared with the CATS
Commissioners.[^whitepaper] Your submission should include all three policy analyses as well as sufficient background and context for a reader who is not
already familiar with NYC pay structures. Note any assumptions or limitations of
your analysis and explain how they might introduce error into your projections.
You are  encouraged to add images and figures as necessary, as well as linking
to prior published analyses of NYC payroll. 

[^whitepaper]: This [recent white
paper](https://rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-Foundation-Aid-Report.pdf)
from the Rockefeller Institute regarding updating NYS' public school 
funding formula is a good example of the genre. Clearly your report does not
need to be this long or this detailed. 

## Extra Credit

There is no extra credit available on this mini-project beyond that specified
in the rubric above. In particular, peer evaluators are authorized to give up
to 8 points (total across all categories) for 

1) Reports that are particularly well-written and include, at a minimum, 
   citations to existing analyses and policy proposal documents raised by local
   think-tanks and political candidates. Such citations are made stronger by
   a comparison of results and outcomes: you shouldn't just say Think-Tank A
   made a similar proposal, but you should also see if your results differ with
   theirs and, if so, report any source(s) of the difference.
2) Policy proposals that are particularly creative and effective. When awarding
   extra credit, peer evaluators should be sure to assess the *political*
   feasibility of proposals. A proposal to, *e.g.*, eliminate all public schools
   would certainly reduce the city's spending on teachers but stands no chance
   of actually being implemented. A good policy proposal is both effective and
   effectible. 


[^prep]: In particular, if you use the CSV export, the names of the columns 
in the data file will be "non-syntactic." This means they are tricky to use in
`R` and require use of backticks throughout your code. You will want to change
these column names before proceeding. The `rename` function can be useful here. 

    ```{r}
#| eval: false
DATA <- DATA |>
      rename(column_name=`Column Name`, 
             other_column=`Other Column`)
    ```

    Note that you will need to change _all_ column names in this fashion.
