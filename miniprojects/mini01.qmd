## Welcome to {{< var course.short >}} Mini Projects!

In the {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects, you will perform basic data
analyses intended to model best practices for your course final project.
(Note, however, that these are *mini*-projects; your final course project is
expected to be far more extensive than any single MP.)

For purposes of MPs, we are dividing the basic data analytic workflow into
several major stages:

-  Data Ingest and Cleaning: Given a single data source, read it into `R` and
   transform it to a reasonably useful standardized format.
-  Data Combination and Alignment: Combine multiple data sources to enable
   insights not possible from a single source.
-  Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Take a data table and compute informative
   summary statistics from both the entire population and relevant subgroups
-  Data Visualization: Generate insightful data visualizations to spur insights
   not attainable from point statistics
-  Inferential Statistical Analysis and Modeling: Develop relevant predictive
   models and statistical analyses to generate insights about the *underlying
   population* and not simply the data at hand.

In this course, our primary focus is on the first four stages: you will take
other courses that develop analytical and modeling techniques for a variety of
data types. As we progress through the course, you will eventually be
responsible for the first four steps. Specifically, you are responsible for the
following stages of each mini-project:

+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+

: Students' Responsibilities in Mini-Project Analyses {.hover}

In early stages of the course, such as this MP, I will 'scaffold' much of the
analysis for you, leaving only those stages we have discussed in class for you
to fill in. As the course progresses, the mini-projects will be more
self-directed and results less standardized.

### Rubric

{{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects are evaluated using *peer grading* with
*meta-review* by the course staff. Specifically, variants of the following 
rubric will be used for the mini-projects:

: Mini-Project Grading Rubric

Note that this rubric is designed with copious opportunities for extra credit if
students go *above and beyond* the instructor-provided scaffolding. Students
pursuing careers in data analytics are strongly encouraged to go beyond the strict
ambit of the mini-projects to i) further refine their skills; ii) learn additional
techniques that can be used in the final course project; and iii) develop a more
impressive professional portfolio.

Because students are encouraged to use {{< var course.short >}} mini-projects as
the basis for a professional portfolio, the basic skeleton of each project will be
released under a fairly permissive usage license. Take advantage of it!

### Submission Instructions

After completing the analysis, write up your findings, *showing all of
your code*, using a dynamic `quarto` document and post it to your course
repository. The `qmd` file should be named `{r} I(mp_file$qmd)` so the
rendered document can be found at `{r} I(mp_file$html_long)` in the student's
repository and served at the URL:[^sub]

> `https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html`

Once you confirm this website works (substituting `<GITHUB_ID>` for the actual GitHub username provided to the professor in [MP#00](./mini00.html) of course), open a new issue at

> `https://github.com/michaelweylandt/{{< var course.repo >}}/issues/new` .

Title the issue `{{< var course.short >}} <GITHUB_ID> MiniProject #{{< meta mp_num >}}` and fill in the following text for the issue:

::: {#submission-text}

```         
Hi @michaelweylandt!

I've uploaded my work for MiniProject #**{{< meta mp_num >}}** - check it out!

https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html
```

:::

Once the submission deadline passes, the instructor will tag classmates for 
peer feedback in this issue thread.

*Additionally*, a PDF export of this report should be submitted on Brightspace.
To create a PDF from the uploaded report, simply use your browser's 'Print to 
PDF' functionality.

**NB**: The analysis outline below specifies key *tasks* you need to perform 
within your write up. Your peer evaluators will check that you complete these. 
You are encouraged to do extra analysis, but the bolded **Tasks** are *mandatory*.

**NB**: Your final submission should look like a *report*, not simply a list of
facts answering questions. Add introductions, conclusions, and your own commentary.
You should be practicing both raw *coding* skills and written *communication* in
all mini-projects. There is little value in data points stated without context or
motivation.

[^sub]: Throughout this section, replace `<GITHUB_ID>` with your GitHub ID from
[Mini-Project #00](./mini00.html), making sure to remove the angle brackets. Note
that the automated course infrastructure will be looking for precise formatting,
so follow these instructions closely. 

## Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}: {{< meta mp_title >}}

Congratulations! You have just started in an exciting new job opportunity: you
are a data analyst at Netflix, tasked with supporting the Public Relations team.
As you may know, Netflix continues to invest heavily in original television and
film content, with the [goal of producing successful "gourmet
cheeseburgers"](https://archive.is/3F35p), *i.e.*, high-quality content that 
is still accessible to and popular with a global mass-market audience. 
Accordingly, the PR team wants to put out a series of press releases highlighting
recent successes. In this project, you will mine Netflix's public [Top
10](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10) data to identify and quantify 
these successes.[^top10]

[^top10]: For this miniproject, we are limited to the data Netflix makes available
to the general public. This data - taking the form of weekly Top 10 charts - 
necessarily omits the long tail of Netflix shows that are not hits, perhaps to
minimize reputational damage of big budget flops. We are also
only able to access global view counts and will have to make some 
(rather ridiculous) assumptions about per country popularity measures. If you
actually worked at Netflix, you would certainly have far more detailed versions
of this data. 

In this mini-project, you will: 

1) Practice use of `dplyr` for analysis of tabular data
2) Practice use of `quarto` and Reproducible Research Tools for Effective
   Communication of Data Analysis Results
3) Begin your professional data science portfolio. 

::: {.callout-warning title="Writing Requirements"}

Recall that you are *evaluated* on writing and communication in these 
Mini-Projects. You are required write a report in the prescribed style, 
culminating in a set of press releases highlighting the success of recent 
Netflix original releases. A submission that performs the instructor-specified 
tasks, but does not write and give appropriate context and commentary will 
score very poorly  on the relevant rubric elements. 

In particular, if a submission does not include "press releases" and only
answers the instructor prompts in narrative text, peer evaluators should judge 
it to have "Good" quality Written Communication (at best) as key findings are 
not conveyed appropriately. 

Quarto's [code 
folding](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code) 
functionality is useful for "hiding" code so that it doesn't break the flow of
your writing. 

You can also make use of [Quarto's `contents`
shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/contents.html) to present
code and findings in an order other than how the code should be executed.
This is particularly useful if you want to include a figure or table in an 
"Executive Summary" at the top of your submission.

:::

### Acquire Data

For this project, we will deal with two separate data files, taken from
[Netflix's TuDum Top 10](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10). These are: 

- Global Top 10 
- Country-wide Top 10

The following code will download the Netflix data and create TSV[^tsv] files in
a `data/mp01` directory. If this doesn't work for whatever reason, you can
download the data directly from Netflix, though you will need to make sure
you are getting the right files and storing them in a location and format
suitable for this mini-project. 

[^tsv]: _Tab_-Separated Values. TSVs are like CSVs, but are a bit more robust
when dealing with text data since some titles may have commas in the name.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
    dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                  destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                  destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

```

You do not (yet) need to understand the code above, so please use the course
discussion board if you have trouble getting it working. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 1: Data Acquisition"}

Using the code above, acquire the latest Netflix Top 10 Data. Copy the code into
your Quarto document and make sure it runs successfully. 

:::

::: {.callout-caution title="Do Not `git add` Data Files"}

Make sure that `git` is set to ignore data files, such as the one created above.
Check the `git` pane in `RStudio` and make sure that `nyc_payroll_export.csv`
does not appear. (If you set up your `.gitignore` file correctly in
[MP#00](./mini00.html), it should already be ignored.) If it is appearing, you
may need to edit your `.gitignore` file.

Removing a large data file from `git` is possible, but difficult. Don't get
into a bad state!

:::

### Data Import and Preparation

Before we can analyze this data, we need to get it into `R` and in a suitable
format. The `read_tsv` function from the `readr` package can be used to read
`tsv` files into `R` (imagine that!). This data comes to use quite well-formated, 
so we will need to only make one small alteration. 

Let's start by reading in the data and using the `str()` and `glimpse()` functions
to examine its structure: 

```{r}
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
str(GLOBAL_TOP_10)
```

```{r}
glimpse(GLOBAL_TOP_10)
```

From these print-outs, we can see various useful pieces of information: 

- The number of rows and columns
- The names of each column
- The _type_ of each column

Make sure you can find each of these in both print-outs. 

Looking more closely, I only see one issue: when the `season_title` is missing 
(*e.g.*, for a movie), it is read into `R` as the _string_ `"N/A"` instead of
a proper `NA` value. This however isn't too hard to fix using a `mutate` command. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 2: Data Cleaning"}

Complete the following code snippet and copy it into your Quarto document. This
will convert `"N/A"` values to proper `NA`s. After fixing this issue, use a 
`str()` or `glimpse()` command to confirm the issue has been addressed. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    mutate(season_title = if_else(..., ..., ...))
```

*Hint*: You will want to use the `is.na` function here. 

:::

The per country data set is similarly organized and also has an issue with reading
`"N/A"` values. While we could repeat the above transformation on this second data
set, we can also address this at the time of data import by passing an additional
argument to `read_csv`. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 3: Data Import"}

Modify the call to `read_tsv` above to read the per-country data file into `R`
as an object called `COUNTRY_TOP_10`. Add an additional argument to `read_tsv`
to ensure that `"N/A"` values are read as `R`'s native `NA` values. After 
reading the data into `R`

*Hint*: `read_tsv` has _many_ optional arguments. Use the 
[function documentation](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html)
to find the one you want. This is the same page that `?read_tsv` gives
you, but presented in a slightly more readable format. 

:::


After completing these two tasks, you should have two data objects: 

- `COUNTRY_TOP_10`
- `GLOBAL_TOP_10`

and the `season_title` of both data sets should have proper `NA` values. 

### Initial Data Exploration

Before preparing our press releases, we will do a bit of _Exploratory Data Analysis_
(EDA). EDA serves many purposes in data science-quality control, hypothesis generation,
outlier identification, etc*-but perhaps the most important is simply knowing
what information can be found in a novel data set. Now that our data is imported
and cleaned, it's time to start our EDA. 

When faced with a new data set, it is tempting to look only at the first few
rows to get a sense of the data: `R` does this by default. In practice, I 
recommend viewing a _random_ selection of rows instead. This won't guarantee you
find any issues, but it increases the probability of finding issues in 
older parts of a data set. 

While we could continue investigating our data using `R`'s basic print-outs, 
this is a good time to introduce a new package `DT` which can create more 
attractive visualizations of your results. The 
[`DT` package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) wraps the Javascript 
[`datatables` library](https://datatables.net/) to provide interactive tables. 
This library has _many_ options to control formatting. Later in this course, you
will also encounter the [`gt` package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) which can be used
to create complex tables natively in `R`.

You can use the `DT` package as follows: 

```{r}
library(DT)
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE))
```

This table has several issues: 

i) The column names are not well-formatted. They are formatted as `R` variables
   instead of as proper "Title Case" names, *e.g.*, `weekly_hours_viewed` should
   be `Weekly Hours Viewed`. 
ii) Large numbers, *e.g.*, `weekly_hours_viewed`, are presented without commas
    or other legibility aids. 
    
Let's address both of these: 

```{r}
library(stringr)
format_titles <- function(df){
    colnames(df) <- str_replace_all(colnames(df), "_", " ") |> str_to_title()
    df
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

This is a closer to a publication-quality title. We should also drop the
`season_title` since here at least we are only showing films. 

```{r}
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    select(-season_title) |>
    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

Finally, showing runtime in hours is a bit awkward, so let's convert this to 
minutes: 

```{r}
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    mutate(`runtime_(minutes)` = round(60 * runtime)) |>
    select(-season_title, 
           -runtime) |>
    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

Much better.

We are now ready to begin some EDA.

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 4: Exploratory Questions"}

Using `dplyr` tools, answer the following questions. If your answer requires
several rows, display your result as an interactive table following the example
above (make sure to make it 'publication quality'). If your answer is a single
name or value, use Quarto's [inline code](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html)
functionality to place the values in a sentence; that is, you should answer in
complete sentences, written as normal text with inline code for computed values.
Note that, depending on the question, you will need to use either the global table
or the per-country table. You will not need to 'combine' tables to answer any
of these questions. 

1. How many different countries does Netflix operate in? (You can use the viewing
   history as a proxy for countries in which Netflix operates.)
2. Which non-English-language film has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global
   top 10? How many weeks did it spend? 
3. What is the *longest* film (English or non-English) to have ever appeared in 
   the Netflix global Top 10? How long is it in minutes? 
   
   Note that Netflix does not provide runtime for programs before a certain
   date, so your answer here may be a bit limited. 
4. For each of the four categories, what program has the most total hours of 
   global viewership? 
5. Which TV show had the longest run in a country's Top 10? How long was this run
   and in what country did it occur?
6. Netflix provides over 200 weeks of service history for all but one country in
   our data set. Which country is this and when did Netflix cease operations
   in that country? 
7. What is the total viewership of the TV show *Squid Game*? Note that there are
   three seasons total and we are looking for the total number of hours watched
   across all seasons.
8. The movie *Red Notice* has a runtime of 1 hour and 58 minutes. Approximately
   how many views did it receive in 2021? 
   
   *Hint*: The `year()` function from the `lubridate` package may be helpful. 
9. How many Films reached Number 1 in the US but did not originally debut there?
   That is, find films that first appeared on the Top 10 chart at, *e.g.*, Number 
   4 but then became more popular and eventually hit Number 1? What is the most
   recent film to pull this off? 
   
   *Hint*: You will want to create a new variable to identify films that topped
   the charts at any point during their run. 
10. Which TV show/season hit the top 10 in the most countries in its debut week? 
    In how many countries did it chart?

### Preparing Press Releases

Now that you have explored this data, it's time to prepare some press releases. 
Each press release should have a catchy headline and about one paragraph of body
text.[^1] Each press release should have at least 3 facts. 

#### Press Release 1: Upcoming Season of *Stranger Things*

Netflix will release the fifth and final season of its hit show *Stranger Things*
at the end of 2025. In preparation for the release, prepare a press release
highlighting the broad impact of the previous four seasons. Your press release
should refer to both the total viewership, the length of popularity (how many 
weeks in the top 10) and the multinational appeal of previous seasons. You 
should also compare the impact of *Stranger Things* to other popular 
English-language TV shows to give a sense of its success. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 5: *Stranger Things* Press Release"}

Write a press release promoting season 5 of *Stranger Things.* Be sure to 
include a catchy headline. 

:::

#### Press Release 2: Commercial Success in India

As the most populated country in the world, India represents a major growth 
opportunity for Netflix. Prepare a press release highlighting Netflix's recent 
successes in Hindi-language films and TV. If you assume that all Hindi-language
viewing is from customers in India (a strong assumption!), you can use this
viewership data to estimate the size of Netflix's customer base in India: compute
a few points and discuss the long term growth trends (if any). 

*Hint*: To get a list of possible films to highlight, look for programs which 
were  very popular in India but did not chart in the US.


::: {.callout-tip title="Task 6: Netflix in India Press Release"}

Write a press release touting the success of Netflix in India and highlighting
recent subscriber growth in the region. Be sure to 
include a catchy headline. 

:::

#### Press Release 3: Open Topic

Finally, create a press release on a topic of your choosing. Your press release
can use either data set (or both) and may focus on TV or films. Your press 
release should be grounded in a meaningful business purpose, *i.e.* highlighting
success, growth, or opportunities in a region. Your press release may be
announcing a new initiative (*i.e.*, a new country in which Netflix is becoming
available) or new conent or celebrating something that has already been released.
The motivation of your press release should be clear from its content. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 7: 3rd Press Release "}

Write a press release on a topic of your choosing. Be sure to 
include a catchy headline. 

:::

[^1]: I can't find Netflix's press release archive online, but here is an example
from HBO Max 
[trumpeting the success](https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/last-us-season-2-trailer-shatters-records-becoming-hbo-and-maxs-most-watched-original)
of the trailer for *The Last of Us* Season 2. This style uses bullet points
instead of a text paragraph, but you can get the general idea. 

## Extra Credit Opportunities

Peer evaluators may award small amounts of extra credit persuant to the rubric
above. 

In particular, particularly entertaining press releases may receive up to
2 points of extra credit and highly insightful press releases (particularly around
item 3) may receive up to 2 points of extra credit. One point of extra credit is
available for inclusion of creative visual element: this may be a statistical chart
(generated using `R`) or some sort of artistic or thematic visualization generated
in other software. (Statistical charts generated in other software, *e.g.*, an Excel
bar chart are not eligible for extra credit.)

No more than 4 points of extra credit may be awarded to a single submission, no
matter how excellent.
