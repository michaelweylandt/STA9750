## Introduction

A suitable introduction goes here. In this mini-project, I intend to demonstrate
my skills at {MP_SKILLS} in an analysis of {MP_DATA} data.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation

Code related to Data Acquisition and Preparation goes here.

Remember that code blocks look like this: 

```{r}
# Your code goes in chunks like this
library(tidyverse) # You will want this line for almost all MPs
x <- 1 + 2 + 3
```

and you can then print variables from chunks: 

```{r}
x
```

or inline, like this: $x$ is `r x`.

## Exploratory Analysis

Code related to Exploratory Data Analysis goes here. This may include
exploratory graphics, instructor-provided exploratory questions, or other
similar elements. 

## Final Insights and Deliverable

Code related to the final deliverable of the assignment goes here.
