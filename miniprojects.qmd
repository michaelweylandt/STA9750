In lieu of traditional homework, {{< var course.short >}} has a series of
**mini-projects** designed to achieve several interlocking goals: 

1. Improve your skills at data analysis
2. Improve your ability to give feedback on data analysis work
3. Seed a 'portfolio' of data science work you can demonstrate 
   to potential employers

Each Mini-Project will be submitted via `GitHub`, an industry-standard code 
management platform, as both raw analysis code and as a HTML document 
hosted on GitHub pages.

After each Mini-Project is submitted, 2-4 peer reviewers will 
be assigned to give feedback and to assign an initial grade following
an instructor provided rubric. This feedback will be given *via* GitHub Issues. 

In order to ensure good peer feedback, the peer feedback will be evaluated by 
the instructor in a "meta-review" worth a small fraction of the overall grade. 

If you believe your mini-project has received inaccurate peer feedback, please
request a regrade from the instructor directly within **48 hours** of the peer 
feedback deadline using the relevant form on Brightspace. No student-initiated 
requests for re-grading will be accepted after that time, though the instructor 
may re-grade the work during the meta-review stage.

### Mini-Projects

#### Mini-Project #00: `r get_mp_title(0)`

```{r}
#| echo: false
mp <-  DATES |> filter(element == "Mini-Projects", item == 0)
```

**Due Dates:**

  - Released to Students: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Released")) |> pull(dt)`
  - **Initial Submission: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
  - **Peer Feedback:**
    - Peer Feedback Assigned: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Assigned")) |> pull(dt)`
    - **Peer Feedback Due: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Due")) |> pull(dt)`**

In the ungraded [Mini-Project #00](./miniprojects/mini00.html), there is no data
analysis required, but you will set up the basic web tooling used to submit projects
#01 to #04. 

Note that, even though ungraded, Mini-Project #00 must be completed to remain
enrolled in this course and before any other Mini-Projects can be submitted. 

#### Mini-Project #01: `r get_mp_title(1)`

```{r}
#| echo: false
mp <-  DATES |> filter(element == "Mini-Projects", item == 1)
```

**Due Dates:**

  - Released to Students: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Released")) |> pull(dt)`
  - **Initial Submission: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
  - **Peer Feedback:**
    - Peer Feedback Assigned: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Assigned")) |> pull(dt)`
    - **Peer Feedback Due: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
    
In [Mini-Project #01](./miniprojects/mini01.html), students will explore the
Netflix Top 10 data to identify the most popular programming on the platform.
Despite the relative simplicity of this data set, it is too big for traditional
spreadsheet software (*i.e.*, Microsoft Excel) to handle. Students deliver their
results in the form of a press release, conveying the results of complex
analytical pipelines in a pithy interpretable format. 

#### Mini-Project #02: `r get_mp_title(2)`

```{r}
#| echo: false
mp <-  DATES |> filter(element == "Mini-Projects", item == 2)
```

**Due Dates:**

  - Released to Students: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Released")) |> pull(dt)`
  - **Initial Submission: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
  - **Peer Feedback:**
    - Peer Feedback Assigned: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Assigned")) |> pull(dt)`
    - **Peer Feedback Due: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
    

In [Mini-Project #02](./miniprojects/mini02.html), students will explore data
from the US Census Bureau's Annual Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to identify cities with 
affordable and rapidly growing housing stock. In this project, students will
combine data from different - and not entirely compatible - government sources
and practice turning a qualitative concept like affordability into a measurable
statistical index. Students also demonstrate basic statistical visualizations
like scatterplots and line charts. Students will deliver their results in the
form of a "policy brief" that can be used to lobby congressional representatives
to advocate pro-housing policies at the federal level.

#### Mini-Project #03: `r get_mp_title(3)`

```{r}
#| echo: false
mp <-  DATES |> filter(element == "Mini-Projects", item == 3)
```

**Due Dates:**

  - Released to Students: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Released")) |> pull(dt)`
  - **Initial Submission: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
  - **Peer Feedback:**
    - Peer Feedback Assigned: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Assigned")) |> pull(dt)`
    - **Peer Feedback Due: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
    
In [Mini-Project #03](./miniprojects/mini03.html), TBD.

#### Mini-Project #04: `r get_mp_title(4)`

```{r}
#| echo: false
mp <-  DATES |> filter(element == "Mini-Projects", item == 4)
```

**Due Dates:**

  - Released to Students: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Released")) |> pull(dt)`
  - **Initial Submission: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Due")) |> pull(dt)`**
  - **Peer Feedback:**
    - Peer Feedback Assigned: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Assigned")) |> pull(dt)`
    - **Peer Feedback Due: `{r} mp |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Mini-Project Peer Feedback Due")) |> pull(dt)`**


In [Mini-Project #04](./miniprojects/mini04.html), TBD. 

### Mini-Project Submission

All Mini-Projects must be submitted in two formats: 

1) As a suitable HTML page hosted on the student's course repository. 
   (See [Mini-Project #00](./miniprojects/mini00.html) for details on
   setting this up.)
2) As a PDF on the course Brightspace page. 

**Both** submissions must be completed _on time_ for the work to be considered
properly submitted. 

- If the work is submitted on Brightspace by the deadline, but not on GitHub,
  the instructor will apply a 5-point penalty (10% deduction). Additionally,
  work not submitted on GitHub will not be eligible for peer review, but
  will instead by evaluated by the course staff. (Note that, historically,
  the instructor and TAs have been more stringent graders than student peers.)

  GitHub submission will be confirmed when the instructor assigns peer
  feedback reviewers. The [course helper
  functions](./tips.html#mp-submission-verify) include a script.
  to confirm that a GitHub submission has been properly formatted. You 
  are encouraged to use it. 
  
  For example, if I wanted to confirm *my* MP03 was properly submitted,
  I would run: 
  
  ```{r}
#| eval: false
source("https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/load_helpers.R")
mp_submission_verify(3, "michaelweylandt")
  ```
  
  **Submissions that do not pass these automated checks will have a
  penalty applied.** 
  
- If the work is submitted on GitHub, but not on Brightspace, the instructor
  will assign a 5 point (10%) penalty. Note that this will be applied by
  the instructor when loading grades into Brightspace; peer evalutors will
  not need to confirm correct Brightspace submission. 
  
- If the work is not submitted on time on either platform, the course
  [late work policy](./resources.html#late-work-policy) applies and no
  credit will be given. 
  
::: {.callout-important title="Mini-Project Submission Grace Period"}

This semester, all Mini-Projects are officially due on *Friday evenings*. 
Recognizing that students have conflicts outside of classes, I am providing
an *automatic two day grace period* (to Sunday evening) for all mini-project
submissions. Per the [late work policy](./resources.html#late-work-policy),
extensions beyond this grace period will only be provided under exceptional
circumstances.

Note, however, I **will not** be responding to student inquiries after the
original (Friday) deadline. You are *strongly* encouraged to ask all questions
and resolve all technology issues before the Friday deadline. 

:::
  
Note that students are still expected to participate in the peer feedback
cycle even if their own submission was not completed on time. Difficulty
with the technologies used (Brightspace, `quarto`, GitHub, *etc.*) is not
a recognized excuse for late submission.

### Mini-Project Formatting

Each mini-project requires submission of _at a minimum_ two files on GitHub: 

1) The `mp0N.qmd` file containing the *source code* of your submission. 
   (Replace `N` with the number of the mini-project; *e.g.*, `mp04.qmd` for 
   Mini-Project #04) This is required so that the instructor, TAs, and 
   peer-evaluators can see your actual submission. In particular, if code does 
   not execute properly or you submit an improperly rendered `html` file, this
   serves as a backstop for evaluation.
2) The `mp0N.html` file containing the *rendered output* of your submission. 
   (Replace `N` with the number of the mini-project; *e.g.*, `mp04.html` for 
   Mini-Project #04) This is what is primarily used for evaluation. 
   
Note that MP#00 is different: in order to create a website, the home page must
be called `index.html`, so the source file is `index.qmd`, not `mp00.qmd`.

#### Make Sure to Submit All Helper Files

For some projects, where you are asked to create data visualizations, you will
need to ensure that other documents are also properly uploaded. In particular,
data visualizations will be saved automatically by `quarto` as `png` files in
your `docs` folder. These need to be included in your GitHub repository so that
your website will render properly: if you omit these, you will get a "missing 
image" icon and empty box instead of the desired visualization. For other projects,
you may need to ensure various `css` or `js` files are uploaded to ensure all
components of your site work properly. You will not need to create or edit these
files directly, but if you don't have them, your page will not appear online
as it does locally. As a general rule, you should `git add`, 
`commit` and `push` _all_ files in the `docs` folder just to be safe. If you
are not seeing something on your page that you observed locally, it is usually
a sign that one of these files are missing.[^inspector]

[^inspector]: If you want to debug this and identify which files are missing on 
GitHub, right click anywhere on the page and open "Developer Tools" or "Inspect"
(depending on the browser you are using). Navigate to the "Network" tab and 
reload the page. You will then see a long list of all of the components that
are used to run your site. Look for files marked with `404` -- the internet code
for missing -- and make sure that the equivalent file is pushed to GitHub in your
`docs` folder. This is a bit advanced and just running `git add docs/*` at the
`Terminal` (not `Console`) adds everything and is easier than hunting down
specific files. 

#### Code Folding

Because you are submitting a single document for both your input (`qmd`) and 
output (`html`), it can be a bit tricky to seamlessly integrate code and text. 
In particular, long chunks of code may ruin the flow of your text. Quarto's 
[code-folding](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code)
functionality can help address this. 

Code folding keeps the code on a page, but hides it behind a "click-to-display"
`<details>` HTML element, by default labelled as `Code`. For example, 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Example adopted from ?filled.contour
x <- 10*1:nrow(volcano)
y <- 10*1:ncol(volcano)
filled.contour(x, y, volcano,
    color.palette = function(n) hcl.colors(n, "terrain"),
    plot.title = title(main = "The Topography of Maunga Whau",
    xlab = "Meters North", ylab = "Meters West"),
    plot.axes = { axis(1, seq(100, 800, by = 100))
                  axis(2, seq(100, 600, by = 100)) },
    key.title = title(main = "Height\n(meters)"),
    key.axes = axis(4, seq(90, 190, by = 10)))  # maybe also asp = 1
mtext(paste("filled.contour(.) from", R.version.string),
      side = 1, line = 4, adj = 1, cex = .66)
```

Above, by default, you see only the output (image) but the
code is hidden unless someone wants to view it. It's pretty easy
to adopt code folding in your own `qmd` files. If you have a code block that 
looks like this: 

````{md}
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
mean(x)
```
````

`quarto` will by default print _both that code and its output_. If you want that
code to be foldable, you need to add an _execution option_ to the top of the 
chunk. It will look like this: 

````{md}
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
mean(x)
```
````

Now, when you render this document, you will just get the output with a little 
"click to expand" thing hiding the code. 

Two note about the syntax: 

- The line has to literally start with `#| `. There can't be a space at the 
  start of the line and there has to be one after the `|` (bar). 
- It also has to appear before any "actual code", so generally it should be the
  first thing in a chunk. 

The syntax for these sort of options is `variable: value`. You should recognize
this from the `_quarto.yml` file in [MP#00](./miniprojects/mini00.qmd) which used
a similar syntax. Here, `code-fold` defaults to `false` (no folding), so we set
it to `true` to turn on folding.[^quarto_flags]

If you want to turn on code-folding for all blocks and change the default from
`true` to `false`, add the following line to the header (lines between the `---`)
of your document: 

```{md}
code-fold: true
```

This will set all code blocks to default turn on code-folding. If you want to
disable code-folding for a particular block, add the execution option 
`#| code-fold: false` to override this new default. 

While code folding is probably the most useful execution option, there are 
other options that you may occasionally find useful. The `echo` option looks
like this: 

````{md}
```{r}
#| echo: false
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
mean(x)
```
````

By default, `quarto` will usually repeat your code back to you before printing
the output. If you just want it to print the output, but no code, set `echo` 
to `false` and it won't echo (repeat back) the code. I do this all the time 
in my notes where I want to compute something, *e.g.*, a due date, and just 
print the result (the date), but I don't want to include the code that calculates
it as it would make my document less clear. When in doubt, you should default to
include your code in your `qmd` document, so you might not use this too often. 

The complement of the `echo` option is `eval`: 

````{md}
```{r}
#| eval: false
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
mean(x)
```
````

This will turn off `evaluation` (running) of the code: here, `quarto` will only 
print the code with nice formatting, but it won't attempt to run it. You won't 
use this much, but I use it all the time when trying to give examples of bad 
code. 

There are [many more](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)
but I'd say `code-fold` and `echo` are the main ones in this class. 

Use of `code-folding` is *not required*, but it is *strongly recommended*.

[^quarto_flags]: One thing that can be a bit confusing: these execution
options are written using `quarto` syntax, not `R` syntax. In particular, these
flags are used by `quarto` and not `R` since they control whether `quarto` 
even runs the code or not: these decisions get made before `R` even starts.
In `quarto`, we turn things on by setting them to `true` (lower case); in 
`R`, we set them to `TRUE` (all caps).

#### Using the `contents` Shortcode

Often, when completing a mini-project, you will want to include text near the 
beginning of the document, such as an Executive Summary, Abstract, or Headline.
The best versions of this introductory text will include the results of your 
analysis later in the document. In particular, if you are putting your code into
a sort of 'technical appendix', almost all of the 'main text' will preceed any
code. You can address this in two ways: 

i) Hard-code the results of your analysis in the intro text: *i.e.*, run the
   code and copy the results into the intro text. 
ii) Using the [`quarto` `contents` shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/contents.html).

A major advantage of using a tool like `quarto` is avoiding hardcoding values
in the text, so I recommend exploring the `contents` shortcode. In brief, the
`contents` shortcode lets you move the _results_ of code to somewhere else
in the document. This is a somewhat advanced trick and not required for this
course, but it can be helpful if you are trying to put a high level of polish
on your submissions.

Here's an example: 

````{r}
#| eval: false
---
title: "An example of the `contents` shortcode"
format: html
---

## Summary

My grandpa always said, {{< contents best_number >}}, but I also really like
{{< contents y_def >}} and I format it strangely because I am a scientist.

## I am using a Shortcode

`quarto` "shortcodes" can be used to do some magic when writing a document.
In this document we use the `contents` shortcode to move _output_ of code 
above the actual code. The [official docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/contents.html)
are not super clear, so hopefully this example helps. 

## Much later in the document

You can see how we find the best number using a very advanced algorithm: 

```{r}
compute_best_number <- function(){
    return(3)
}

x <- compute_best_number()

y <- x + 3
```

We will define some 'snippets' here, but they do not get printed here because 
we instead move the output up earlier in the document. 

[The very best number is `{{r}} x`]{#best_number}

[`{{r}} formatC(y, format="e", digits=2)`]{#y_def}
````

A few things to note here: 

i) Like always, the code runs top-to-bottom, so we have to define `x` in the 
   `{{r}}` chunk before using it. 
ii) Once we have defined `x` and `y`, we then use _inline code syntax_ to
    put them inside text. 
iii) The text is given an identifier using the `[text with inline code]{#id}`
     syntax. This is _almost_ the link syntax, but with curly braces instead of
     parenthesis and a mandatory `#` symbol. 
iv)  We then move the named text snippets elsewhere in the document using the
     `{{{< contents NAME >}}}` syntax. Here `NAME` is the name you assigned
     to the snippet, *i.e.*, the text after the `#`. `NAME`s should only contain
     letters, numbers, and underscores.
v) You can use a snippet in multiple places: the code is only run once, but
   the results will be printed as many times as you use the `contents` shortcode.

When you render this document, `quarto` will first run the chunk to define
`x` and `y`; then it will put them in inline text snippets; then it will move
those snippets elsewhere in the document. That last step is something that does
not happen with basic `quarto` usage. 

As this example shows, a snippet may include text but it can also just be some
inline code that will print a variable with the desired formatting. 

Note that a snippet **cannot be the only thing on a line**. If you have a line
which is only `{{{< contents NAME >}}}`, you will get a warning message that
states: "This might happen because the shortcode is used in div context, while 
the id corresponds to a span. Removing from document." It is possible to work
around this, but it requires a different syntax. If you need to have contents
alone on a line, typically because you want to move a code chunk, instead of
inline code, a different syntax is required: contact the instructor for details. 

**Use of the `contents` shortcode is advanced and not required.**

### Mini-Project Peer Feedback {#peer-feedback}

The *peer feedback cycle* is an important element of the {{< var course.short >}}
learning goals. In particular, the peer feedback activities are used to help
students learn to _read code written by others_ and to _compare and contrast 
alternative approach to the same analytic aims_. As emphasized throughout this 
course, there is rarely a single **right** way to perform a particular piece of
analysis, but there are **better** and **worse**; seeing a variety of approaches
helps students experience a variety of approaches and begin developing a sense of
elegance and efficiency in code. 

Mini-Project peer feedback is submitted as comment on the GitHub issue used to
submit individual projects. Once the mini-project submission deadline passes, 
the instructor will tag multiple students in the same issue and request peer
feedback. Tagged students ("evaluators") should give their feedback in that same
issue, **not** opening a new issue. (This is important to keep course materials
organized.) 

Peer feedback comments should use the following format:

::: {#peer-feedback-template}

```{md}
## Scores 

- Written Communication: NN 
- Project Skeleton: NN
- Formatting & Display: NN
- Code Quality: NN
- Data Preparation: NN
- Extra Credit: NN

## Comments

OPTIONAL TEXT

### Written Communication

TEXT TEXT TEXT

### Project Skeleton

TEXT TEXT TEXT

### Formatting & Display

TEXT TEXT TEXT

### Code Quality

TEXT TEXT TEXT

### Data Preparation

TEXT TEXT TEXT

### Extra Credit

TEXT TEXT TEXT
```

:::

For each element, the `NN` should be replaced by a numerical value
between 0 and 10. (It is not necessary to provide a sum; the instructor will
calculate this.) Similarly, the `TEXT TEXT TEXT` should be replaced by comments
justifying the assigned score. If you have overall comments on the assignment,
not appropriate for a single category, please place them in the `OPTIONAL TEXT`
section. (If you have no overall comments for this section, just delete this.)
Not all mini-projects have opportunities for Extra Credit, but please leave
those blocks in place (with a 0 for the score and something to the effect of 
"No extra credit available" for the  comment) so the course backend automation
works properly. The `mp_feedback_submit` function in the 
[course helper functions](./tips.qmd#mp_feedback_submit) can be used to
automatically format peer feedback according to the required template. 

The `mp_feedback_verify` function in the 
[course helper functions](./tips.qmd#mp_feedback_verify) can be used to 
verify that you have submitted a comment with the correct formatting.

::: {.callout-caution title="Peer Grade Required for **All** Assigned Work"}

Please note that you are *required* to provide a peer grade
for *all* mini-projects to which you have been assigned, even
those where no submission can be found. Please use the template
above and assign 0s for all elements. Text feedback should also
be included, but it can be as simple as "No submission found."

:::

After the peer feedback cycle, the instructor will collect peer feedback grades
and assign "meta-review" feedback to each student. Meta-review feedback refers 
a grade based on the quality of your commentary. The following rubric will guide
assessment of meta-review grades, but the instructor may deviate as appropriate.

Note that the rubric is a bit *asymmetric*: students need more detailed 
feedback on poor work -- giving them an opportunity to improve -- than on 
strong work. Here the rough "strong" *vs* "weak" distinction is qualitative and 
will be assessed by the instructor independently as part of meta-review grades.

| Score | Quality of Submitted Work | Quality of Feedback | Comments |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 9-10 | Strong | Quality Positive Feedback |  |
| TBD | Strong | Quality Negative Feedback | Addressed on a case-by-case basis. |
| 7-8 | Strong | Minimal Positive Feedback |  |
| 5-6 | Strong | Minimal Negative Feedback |  |
| 4 | Strong | No Feedback |  |
| 4-5 | Weak | Quality Positive Feedback |  |
| 9-10 | Weak | Quality Negative Feedback |  |
| 4-5 | Weak | Minimal Positive Feedback |  |
| 6-8 | Weak | Minimal Negative Feedback |  |
| 3 | Weak | No Feedback |  |

: Meta-Review Rubric

Note that if your comment is not properly formatted, as determined
by `mp_feedback_verify`, a penalty will be applied to your meta-review score.
