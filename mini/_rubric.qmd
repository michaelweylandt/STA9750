* - Course Element
  - Excellent (9-10)
  - Great (7-8)
  - Good (5-6)
  - Adequate (3-4)
  - Needs Improvement (1-2)
* - Written Communication
  - Report is very well-written and flows naturally. Motivation for key steps is
    clearly explained to reader without excessive detail. Key findings are
    highlighted and appropriately given sufficient context, including reference
    to related work where appropriate.
  - Report has no grammatical or writing issues.[^gptwriting] Writing is 
    accessible and flows naturally. Key findings are highlighted and clearly
    explained, but lack suitable motivation and context.
  - Report has no grammatical or writing issues. Key findings are present but 
    insufficiently highlighted or unclearly explained.
  - Writing is intelligible, but has some grammatical errors. Key findings 
    are difficult to discern.
  - Report exhibits significant weakness in written communication. Key points 
    are nearly impossible to identify.
* - Project Skeleton
  - Code completes all instructor-provided tasks correctly. Responses to 
    open-ended tasks are **especially** insightful and creative.
  - Code completes all instructor-provided tasks satisfactorily. Responses
    to open-ended tasks are insightful, creative, and do not have any minor
    flaws. 
  - Response to one instructor provided task is skipped, incorrect, or 
    otherwise incomplete. Responses to
    open-ended tasks are solid and without serious flaws. 
  - Responses to two instructor provided tasks are skipped, incorrect, or 
    otherwise incomplete. Responses to open-ended tasks are acceptable, but
    have at least one serious flaw. 
  - Response to three or more instructor provided tasks are skipped, 
    incorrect, or otherwise incomplete. Responses to open-ended tasks are 
    seriously lacking. 
* - Tables & Document Presentation
  - Tables go beyond standard publication-quality formatting, using advanced 
    features like color formatting, interactivity, or embedded visualization.
  - Tables are well-formatted, with publication-quality selection of data to 
    present, formatting of table contents (*e.g.*, significant figures) and
    column names.
  - Tables are well-formatted, but still have room for improvement in one 
    of these categories: subsetting and selection of data to present, formatting
    of table contents (*e.g.*, significant figures), column names. 
  - Tables lack significant 'polish' and need improvement in substance 
    (filtering and down-selecting of presented data) or style. Document is 
    difficult to read due to distracting formatting choices. 
  - Unfiltered 'data dump' instead of curated table. Document is illegible at
    points. 
* - Data Visualization
  - Figures go beyond standard publication-quality formatting, using advanced 
    features like animation, interactivity, or advanced plot types implemented
    in `ggplot2` extension packages.
  - Figures are 'publication-quality,' with suitable axis labels, well-chosen 
    structure, attractive color schemes, titles, subtitles, and captions, *etc.*
  - Figures are above 'exploratory-quality' and reflect a moderate degree of
    polish, but do not reach full 'publication-quality' in one-to-two ways. 
  - Figures are above 'exploratory-quality' and reflect a moderate degree of
    polish, but do not reach full 'publication-quality' in three or more distinct
    ways. 
  - Figures are suitable to support claims made, but are 'exploratory-quality,'
    reflecting zero-to-minimal effort to customize and 'polish' beyond `ggplot2`
    defaults.
* - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Deep and 'story-telling' EDA identifying non-obvious patterns that are then 
    used to drive further analysis in support of the project. All patterns and 
    irregularities are noted and well characterized, demonstrating mastery and
    deep understanding of all data sets used. 
  - Meaningful ‘story-telling’ EDA identifying non-obvious patterns in the data. 
    Major and pinor patterns and irregularities are noted and well characterized 
    at a level sufficient to achieve the goals of the analysis. EDA demonstrates
    clear understanding of all data sets used. 
  - Extensive EDA that thoroughly explores the data, but lacks narrative and 
    does not deliver a meaningful ‘story’ to the reader. Obvious patterns or 
    irregularities noted and well characterized, but more subtle structure may 
    be overlooked or not fully discussed. EDA demonstrates competence and 
    basic understanding of the data sets used. 
  - Solid EDA that identifies major structure to the data, but does not fully 
    explore all relevant structure. Obvious patterns or irregularities ignored
    or missed. EDA demonstrates familiarity with high-level structure of the
    data sets used. 
  - Minimal EDA, covering only standard summary statistics, and providing 
    limited insight into data patterns or irregularities. EDA fails to 
    demonstrate familiarity with even the most basic properties of the data
    sets being analyzed. 
* - Code Quality
  - Code is (near) flawless. Intent is clear throughout and all code is 
    efficient, clear, and fully idiomatic. 

    Code passes all `styler` and `lintr` type analyses without issue.
  - Comments give context and structure of the analysis, not simply defining 
    functions used in a particular line. Intent is clear throughout, but code
    can be minorly improved in certain sections. 
    
  - Code has well-chosen variable names and basic comments. Intent is generally
    clear, though some sections may be messy and code may have serious clarity
    or efficiency issues. 
  - Code executes properly, but is difficult to read. Intent is generally clear
    and code is messy or inefficient. 
  - Code fails to execute properly.
* - Data Preparation
  - Data import is fully-automated and efficient, taking care to only download 
    from web-sources if not available locally. All data cleaning steps are
    fully-automated and robustly implemented, yielding a clean data set that
    can be widely used. 
  - Data is imported and prepared effectively, in an automated fashion with 
    minimal hard-coding of URLs and file paths. Data cleaning is fully-automated
    and sufficient to address all issues relevant to the analysis at plan. 
  - Data is imported and prepared effectively, though source and destination 
    file names are hard-coded. Data cleaning is rather manual and hard-codes
    most transformations.
  - Data is imported in a manner likely to have errors. Data cleaning is 
    insufficient and fails to address clear problems.
  - Data is hard-coded and not imported from an external source. 
* - Analysis and Findings
  - Analysis demonstrates uncommon insight and quality, providing unexpected
    and subtle insights. 
  - Analysis is clear and convincing, leaving essentially no doubts 
    about correctness. 
  - Analysis clearly appears to be correct and passes the "sniff test" for
    all findings, but a detailed review notes some questions remain unanswered. 
  - Analysis is not clearly flawed at any point and is likely to be within the
    right order of magnitude for all findings. 
  - Analysis is clearly incorrect in at least one major finding, reporting 
    clearly implausible results that are likely off by an order of magnitude or more.

Note that the "Excellent" category for most elements applies only to truly 
exceptional "above-and-beyond" work. Most student submissions will likely fall
in the "Good" to "Great" range. 

[^gptwriting]: This the level of "ChatGPT-level" prose, without obvious flaws
but lacking the style and elegance associated with true quality writing.
