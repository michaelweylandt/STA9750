## Extra Credit Opportunities {#extra_credit}

There are optional *Extra Credit Opportunities* where extra points can be 
awarded for specific additional tasks in this mini-project. The amount of the 
extra credit is typically not proportional to the work required to complete 
these tasks, but I provide these for students who want to dive deeper into this
project and develop additional data analysis skills not covered in the main part
of this mini-project.

For this mini-project, no more than {{< meta mp_max_ec >}} total points of extra
credit may be awarded. **Even with extra credit, your grade on this mini-project
cannot exceed 80 points total.**
