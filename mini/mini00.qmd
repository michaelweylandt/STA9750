In lieu of traditional homework, this course has a set of four *mini-projects*,
which will be assessed in two stages. In the first, you will complete a small 
data analysis project[^1]; after submission of your analysis, it will be assigned
to a classmate, who will evaluate it according to an instructor-provided rubric.
This *peer feedback* stage is an opportunity to see how your classmates answered
questions and to compare it to your own response. In doing so, you will learn to
evaluate data science work product and will develop a critical eye that can be
turned to your own work.

This *mini-project*, however, is a *meta-mini-project*, designed to help
you set up the course infrastructure you will use for the four graded
mini-projects.

**NB: Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}} is not graded, but it is required.
Without completing the activities described in this section, you will not be
able to submit later (graded) mini-projects.**

*Estimated Time to Complete: 2 Hours*

*Estimated Time for Peer Feedback: 1 Hour*

---

This course will use the industry-standard code sharing platform [`GitHub`](https://github.com). 
Mini-projects and course-projects will be submitted by posting to a
relevant GitHub project and creating a world-readable HTML page. A secondary
goal of this course is to help students build a web-presence and a data science
portfolio, giving you a place to showcase your skills to potential employers. 
The four mini-projects and the final course project should form an excellent
basis for a portfolio. The main aim of Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}} is
to set up the "skeleton" of this portfolio. 

You may choose to complete these tasks under a [*pseudonym*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym) if you do not want
current or potential employers, classmates, or the world at large to see your
work. You will be required to disclose your pseudonym to the instructor. If you
choose to use a pseudonym, it will be straightforward to add your name to any
or all coursework after the semester ends. Within the course, you
will have the option to switch to a pseudonym as desired, but it is difficult
to fully anonymize anything once it has been posted on the public internet. 
With all those cautions, please take a moment to reflect as to whether you wish
to proceed under your own name or using a pseudonym. 

## Step 0: Install `git`

You first need to make sure you have `git` installed on your computer. You may
already have it, but if you don't the following steps can make sure it is 
installed. To check if it is installed, open a Terminal and run `git` (Mac)
or `git.exe` (Windows). If you get a message other than "not found", you should
be good to go. 

For more detailed instructions, see [Chapter 6](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git)
of the [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com) book.

### Windows

If you are on a Windows machine, install `git` using the [Git for
Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) bundle. 

### Mac

If you are on a Mac, run the following command at the Terminal: 

> `xcode-select --install`

This will prompt you to install the "XCode Command Line Tools" which include
git. 





## Stage 1: GitHub Account Creation

To complete this course, you will need a free `GitHub` personal account, which 
you can create [here](https://github.com/signup). Please note that whatever 
account name you use will be public, so you need to define a pseudonym here
if you choose to use one.

::: {.callout-note title="Git vs GitHub" collapse="true"}

It's important to keep `git` (a program) and `GitHub` (a website) straight in
your head. `git` is a version control system that keeps records of different
versions of your code; `GitHub` is just a website that plays nice with `git` 
and can be used to store copies of `git` data. You can use `git` with many other
websites and tools - commercial alternatives to `GitHub` are `BitBucket` and
`GitLab`, but you could even use Dropbox to keep copies of your `git` data
if you really want to, but I wouldn't recommend it.[^gitdropbox]

If you think of `git` as a replacement for the practice of having 

- `Document_v1.docx`
- `Document_v2.docx`
- `Document_final.docx`
- `Document_final_final.docx`
- `Document_final_approved.docx`

and instead storing these all in a single file using "Track Changes" at a super
high level, `GitHub` is roughly SharePoint: not the software used to write files,
of the software used to track changes, but a useful site for keeping backups
and sharing within an organization.

:::

[^gitdropbox]: `git`'s history won't play nicely with
Dropbox's version history. Trying to keep a `git` repo inside a `Dropbox` 
folder is generally a bad idea.

## Stage 2: Course Repo Creation

### Creating GitHub Repo

Now that you have created a GitHub account, log in and proceed to your dashboard
at [https://github.com](https://github.com). In the top right corner, 
click the `+` symbol and select "New Repository."[^2][^year]

![](../images/gh_topbar.png) 

Create a new repository named `{{< var course.repo >}}` with a suitable description. 

![](../images/gh_new_repo.png) 

This repo needs to be *public*. You do not need to select a `README`, 
`.gitignore`, or a license at this time. 

After you create your repo, you should see a page like this: 

![](../images/empty_repo.png)

Note the URL highlighted in the main box: 

**``https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ID/{{< var course.repo >}}.git``**

You will need this in the next step.

[^year]: Note that these images are taken from a previous offering of this course.
Update to the current semester as appropriate. 

#### Disable Issue Submission

Return to your repository home page,  go to the top of the page, hit the 
`Settings` button, and scroll down to `Features`. Alternatively, just go to 

> `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ID/{{< var course.repo >}}/settings#features`

Once there, uncheck the checkbox for `Issues` to prevent accidental posting 
of content to your repository. All course submissions and follow-on
discussion will take place in _my_ repository at: 

> `https://github.com/michaelweylandt/{{< var course.repo >}}/issues`


### Connecting GitHub Repo to RStudio

Now that you have set up an *empty* repo, you need to connect it to your personal machine
and to RStudio. RStudio's concept of [projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) roughly
map to GitHub repos and that is what we will use here. 

Open RStudio and click the project menu in the top right corner: 

![](../images/project_menu.png)

Follow through the menu to click: 

- New Project
- Version Control
- Git 

This will take you to the following screen:

![](../images/new_project_wizard.png)

Copy the `.git` URL from the previous step into `Repository URL`.[^3]

### Securing Connections to GitHub

An important aspect of source code management is *access control* to your code
repository. While it's typically no risk to make your code _world-readable_, you
don't want just anyone being able to add code to your repository. Traditionally,
this type of access would be controlled with a username+password scheme, but
GitHub has moved to a _Access Token_ structure. 

This process is a "one-time" task, documented in the [Connect Section](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro)
of the *Happy Git with R* book, but we'll cover the highlights here. 

#### Git Credential Manager

Before starting, you will want to make sure you have installed the Git Credential
Manager (GCM). If you used the [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) 
bundle, you already have GCM installed. If you are on a Mac, you can download 
the GCM installer [directly](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases) 
or install GCM via the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

#### GitHub Personal Access Token

Next, you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub. You can think
of this as a "special-purpose" password. Unlike your general account password, 
a PAT can be restricted to only perform certain activities or only for a limited
time period. Like any password, your PAT should not be shared with anyone else.

The easiest way to do so is to run the following code: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
if(!require("usethis")) install.packages("usethis")
usethis::create_github_token()
```

**Make sure you set the Expiration Date for your PAT after the 
end of the semester.** If you need to regenerate a PAT because it expires, you
can simply repeat the steps here, but setting a long-dated expiration will save
a possible hiccup in the future.

Once you have created a token, copy and save it on your computer. (Note that you
only be able to copy it one time, so make sure you save it somewhere memorable.)
Then run the following code to register the GitHub PAT on your computer: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
if(!require("gitcreds")) install.packages("gitcreds")
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

Once you do this, your PAT will be stored in your computer's password storage
(Apple Keychain on a Mac; similar on Windows). Now that your PAT is in an
"official" location, any time `git` needs to use it to talk to `GitHub`, it
will know where to find it. This saves you the hassle of holding on to a PAT
and retyping it constantly. Once this is all set up, you should (hopefully)
never need to think about PATs again. 

::: {.callout-caution title="Setting Up Tokens by Hand" collapse="true"}

If these commands don't work, you can also perform the same steps "by hand":

After logging in to GitHub via a web browser, visit
[https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
to begin the token creation process. Give the token a meaningful name and
description and set an expiration date after (at least) the end of the semester. 

Set the "Repository Access" to "All repositories" and, under 
"Permissions > Repository Permissions", set "Contents" to "Read and Write". This
will now let anyone using your token _read and write_ to all your repositories.
After you create your token, you will be given **only one opportunity** to copy
it. (Note that you can change permissions later, but you can only copy the token
once.) Copy this and save it for later use. If you loose this token, you may need
to generate a new one. 

When you make your first push to GitHub (as described below), use this token
as your password. If everything is set up correctly, GCM will save this token
and use it to authenticate you every time you push to GitHub. You should not 
need to paste this token every time. 

:::

### `.gitignore`

This course will involve many files, not all of which you will want to push
to `GitHub`. Create a file named `.gitignore` and paste in the following to 
tell `git` to ignore certain files. If creating this in `RStudio`, 
create it as a "Text File", not an "R Script". (Also make sure to keep the
leading `.` in the file name.) 

```{md}
**/.quarto/*
.Rproj.user
data/**
**/*_cache/*
*_files/*
**/*_freeze/*
**/*tsv*
**/*csv*
**/*xlsx*
**/*zip
**/*pdf
**/*json
**/*rds
.DS_Store
.Rhistory
/.quarto/*
**/gganim*
```

You may already have a `.gitignore` file created automatically for you by 
`RStudio`. If so, simply open it (by clicking the file name in the 
`Files` pane of `RStudio`) and add the above lines at the bottom. 

This file essentially gives `git` instructions not to save any of the various
types of _output_ of code (PDFs, Excel files). There is a time and place
for saving these files, but in this course _code is truth_ and the output files
are just an artifact of running that code. Conceptually, you can think of
this as the fact that an old family secret chocolate cake is stored as
a recipe (code), not by keeping a very old and moldy cake hidden in the
back of the fridge. 

### Additional `git` configuration

You will, from time to time, need to send somewhat large files to GitHub, 
primarily high-resolution figures. Since `git` is primarily designed for 
small-ish text files (code), this can be a bit tricky, but you can increase
the maximum transferrable size by running the following command at the 
`Terminal`. 

```
git config --global http.postbuffer 524288000
```

This only increases a limit - you might still run into problems with
exceptionally large files, *esp.* data files if you do not set your `.gitignore`
up properly - but it should avoid most problems. 

Next, run the following at the `Terminal`:

```
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

This will tell `git` to use the term "main" for your first
branch. We won't use branches in this course, but this
can eliminate some issues. 

### `git` Check

At this point, run the following code to check your `git` setup: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
if(!require("usethis")) install.packages("usethis")
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

This will print out a large amount of helpful information, but the important
things to check are: 

- Are your name and email set correctly?
- Is your GitHub user set correctly? 
- Does the token have the requisite "repo" scope? 
- Is the "origin" set correctly for the GitHub project? 


::: {.callout-caution title="Default branch mismatch between local repo and remote." collapse=true}

Certain older versions of `git` will use the default name
`master` for the initial branch (though the command above
should address this). If you get the message 

> `Default branch mismatch between local repo and remote.`

from `git_sitrep()`, proceed to make your first commit (as
described below) and then run the command

```
git branch -m main
```

This should eliminate the above issue. Note that this command
needs to be run *between* making your first commit and 
*pushing* that first commit. 

:::



### Initial Commit and Push

Now, to make sure everything is working, let's save a basic `README` file and
push it to GitHub. This is a plain text file with no particular structure. 

To create it, click the new file button in RStudio (top left; piece of paper with
a green plus) and select `Text File`. RStudio will open this file in the editor: type some basic content, *e.g.*, 

```
Submission materials for {{< var course.short >}} at Baruch College. 

Owner: <YOURNAME>
```

(It doesn't matter what you push: whatever you type will be the default text appearing
when someone visits your repo.)

Save the file and open the `Git` pane in RStudio.

![](../images/git_pane_nostage.png)

Check the box next to the `README` file to `stage` it for `git`.

![](../images/git_pane_staged.png)

Then click the  `Commit` button a type a brief message (`Initial commit` 
is fine). Once you have typed your message, hit the `Commit` button
under the message box to make your first commit. 

Note that you have to type _something_ here: if you leave the box blank,
it will do nothing: all commits require a message, no matter how simple. 

![](../images/git_precommit.png)

::: {.callout-warning title="Two Separate Commit Buttons"}

Note that there are two separate `Commit` buttons you need to press. 
The first `Commit` button, which is in the "main" `RStudio` window in the
top left portion of the `Git` pane next to an icon of a pice of paper with a
green checkmark, brings up the `Commit` window. The second `Commit` button-in
the pop-up window-is the one that actually does the act of committing. 

This is sort of like when you click "Save As" in other software: you
then have to actually "Save" in the secondary menu that comes up.

:::

Finally, push the  `Push` button. If everything works, you should see a screen like the below: 

![](../images/git_postcommit.png)

To confirm everything worked, return to the GitHub repo in your browser. You should see
the text of your `README` file displayed at the bottom of the page. 

::: {.callout-caution title="Error: Cannot run `gpg`" collapse="true"}

Occasionally, students will get an error message stating `Cannot run gpg`
when trying to make their initial commit. If this happens to you, make sure
you have not checked a `Sign this Commit` button in the `Commit` wizard. If
that box is not checked (or does not appear), try following
[these instructions](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/version-control.html#git-commit-signing)
to make sure `RStudio` is set to use `gpg` automatically. 

If you have 'unchecked' that box but you are still getting the `gpg` error,
it is likely that something in your `git` settings is requiring `gpg`. 
I don't know why this happens to some students, but it's an easy fix: 
go to the `Terminal` tab in `RStudio` (not the same as the `Console`!) and
run the following commands:

```
git config commit.gpgsign false
git config --global commit.gpgsign false
```

These will turn of the default use of `gpg` in `git`. 

Taken together these two steps seem to be sufficient for making sure
`gpg` is never invoked by `git` or `RStudio`. 

[`gpg`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) is a powerful privacy
and identity verification software that can be used to prove that you are 
the actual author of your `git` commits. If you have used it elsewhere and want
to use it in this course, that's fine, but it is certainly not required. 

:::

## Stage 3: Personal Website Creation

Now that you created a place where you can push files to GitHub and have successfully
pushed a basic `README`, it's time to build a webpage using [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/).

We will need three pages to build a website: 

1. A configuration file, `_quarto.yml`, used to specify the
   look and layout of your website. 
2. An `index.qmd` file used to create the homepage. 
3. A build script to create the website. 

### Configuration File

Open a new text file and save it as `_quarto.yml`. This is a
configuration file used by `quarto` to control the layout of your site. 
For a bare-bones site, copy the following into `_quarto.yml`:

````
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "{{< var course.short >}} Submission Material"
  description:
    Course Projects for {{< var course.short >}} at Baruch College
  site-url: "https://YOUR_GITHUB_ID.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/"
  navbar:
    background: primary
    search: false
    
format:
  html:
    theme: THEME
    toc: false

editor:
  mode: source
````

Note that the indentation pattern is important so copy this exactly. 

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_ID` with your GitHub user name.

For `THEME`, visit the [Bootswatch theme gallery](https://bootswatch.com/)
and pick your preferred theme. Replace `THEME` with a lower case version
of the theme name; if you want to use the [Sandstone
theme](https://bootswatch.com/sandstone/) used for this course website,
`THEME` will be `sandstone` (NB: lower case).
See, *e.g.*, the [`_quarto.yml` used for this course](https://github.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750/blob/main/_quarto.yml#L41).

[^brks]: Here and everywhere in this course, whenever you are replacing 
a placeholder  of the form `<VALUE>` with an actual value, make sure to remove
the angle brackets.

Once you have created this `_quarto.yml`, stage it (click the check mark) 
in RStudio's git pane. 

### `index.qmd`

Next, we'll build your home page, conventionally called `index.html`. We will
not write the HTML code by hand - it's quite cumbersome - and will instead
let `quarto` create it for us. Create another plain text file and save it as
`index.qmd`. 

This file will be divided into two parts, a header giving the *metadata*
for the site, and a body, giving the *content* of the site.

First write the header, separated by three horizontal bars (minus signs)
above and below. For now, all you need to specify is a `title`: 

```{md}
---
title: "YOUR TITLE GOES HERE"
---
```

Below the header, write the basic content of your website: a brief introduction
of who you are.[^4] You can use `markdown` here for formatting. Basic text will
suffice, but this is also a great opportunity to include things like a personal
headshot, a link to a full resume, or similar. 

As you work on this, click the "Render" button at the top of the editor pane to 
see what your site will look like. 


### Additional Set-Up - Rendered Code

In order to make sure that your `R` and `quarto` environment has been properly
configured, it is necessary to include to include a bit of `R` code in your
submission. At this point in the course, you are not required to write any `R`
code of your own, so I've written some options here. Pick one to include
in your submission - or modify them to do something else fun. If there's something
else you'd like to include, reach out to the instructor and I might be able to
help you put something together. 

Once you are happy with this landing page and have included on of these dynamic
components (or similar), stage it and we'll move on to building the 
website properly. 

#### Last Updated

The following code will add a "Last Updated:" footer at the bottom of your page. 

````{md}
```{r}
#| include: false
1+1
```
--------------
Last Updated: `r format(Sys.time(), "%A %m %d, %Y at %H:%M%p")`
````

::: {.callout-warning}

Note that the `1+1` block will not actually be printed because of the 
`#| include: false` flag, but it is necessary to force `quarto` to execute
inline code blocks. Alternatively, you can add `engine: knitr` to the
document header (where the title is specified). See [Discussion at
Github](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/12029) or the [Engine 
Binding](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html#engine-binding) 
documentation. 

:::

#### Baruch Map

The following adds a map with the location of Baruch College. You can change
the GPS coordinates and text to another place of relevance to you.

````{md}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

if(!require("leaflet")){
    options(repos=c(CRAN="https://cloud.r-project.org"))
    install.packages("leaflet")
    stopifnot(require("leaflet"))
}

baruch_longitude <- -73.98333
baruch_latitude  <- +40.74028

leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, zoom=17) |>
  addPopups(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, 
            "I am a Master's student at <b>Baruch College</b>!")
```
````

#### Resume Hosting

TODO: If you have a copy of your resume available as a PDF...


### `build_site.R`

Finally, open a new file - but now it's an `R` script, not a text file, in RStudio. 
Copy the following into `build_site.R`: 

```
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
if(!require("quarto")){
    install.packages("quarto")
}
library(quarto)
if(!quarto::quarto_binary_sitrep()){
    stop("Something is wrong with your quarto installation.")
}
quarto::quarto_render(".")

system("git add docs/*")
if(file.exists("index.qmd")){
    system("git add index.qmd")
}
if(length(Sys.glob("mp0*.qmd")) > 0){
    system("git add mp0*.qmd")
}

if(!any(grepl("rstudio", search()))){q("no")}
```

Click the `Source` button in the top-right corner of the editor pane to run 
this code. If everything works, it will build your website and automatically 
stage it the built files. Stage `build_site.R` as well. 

Finally, `Commit` all these staged files and `Push` them to GitHub. You have now
created a website and just need to turn on a web server so you can access it. 

## Stage 4: GitHub Pages Deployment

### Activate GitHub Pages Server

Return to the GitHub repo you created; recall that the URL is something like:

> `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ID/{{< var course.repo >}}/`


Open the "Settings" menu at the top of the page and proceed to the "Pages" 
submenu. You should  see a  page that looks like this: 

![](../images/pages_window.png)

Alternatively, you can go directly to this page by visiting: 

> `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ID/{{< var course.repo >}}/settings/pages`

Under `Build and Deployment`, set the `main` branch to deploy and
select the `docs` directory on that branch. Hit save and your website
will go live!

To check your website is working, proceed to 

`https://YOUR_GITHUB_ID.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}`

If everything works, you will see your site! (If you used the `Render`
feature in  RStudio, it should look familiar.) 

If you get stuck, use the course discussion board to seek help from
your classmates and, if necessary, the instructor. 

::: {.callout-note title="GitHub Job Failed" collapse="true"}

The GitHub Pages Deplay job -- the steps run to update your website -- almost
always complete without issue. If they do not succeed, you will typically get
an automated email from GitHub informing you that the job failed. 

The most common cause of failure is running GitHub pages without a `docs`
folder. If the error email (or possibly the text it links to), ends with
something like: 

> No such file or directory @ dir_chdir0 - /github/workspace/docs

You have not uploaded the `docs` folder to GitHub properly. Return to an early
step to fix this, push a new commit, and the problem should resolve automatically
as soon as a `docs` folder (with contents) is uploaded. 

:::


## Stage 5: Submission

Once your site is live, you will submit it to the instructor in three steps: 

1) Log into the course discussion board (Piazza) and send me your GitHub
   name so I can link it to my gradebook. 
2) Tag `@michaelweylandt` on GitHub to make sure I can access your repo.
3) Submit a PDF copy of your assignment through Brightspace.

All three steps must be completed to complete the assignment.

### Discussion Board (Piazza)

First, send me a **private** message through the course discussion board with the 
following details:

- Real Name
- CUNY EmplID (8 digit ID code)
- CUNY email
- GitHub user name

This is the only place where you are required to connect your GitHub ID 
with your  real name and CUNY credentials. I need this information to connect
your public activity with my (private) gradebook and the CUNY system. 
When I receive this information and enter it into the course back-end, I will 
provide you a private passcode. This passcode will be used to submit anonymous
peer feedback, so please note it and save it for later use. 


### Instructor Tagging

Next, you're going to contact me through `GitHub`: go to[^sub] 

`https://github.com/michaelweylandt/{{< var course.repo >}}/issues/new`

to open a new issue. Title the issue `{{< var course.short >}} YOUR_GITHUB_ID 
MiniProject #{{< meta mp_num >}}` and fill in the following text for the issue:

::: {#submission-text}

Hi @michaelweylandt!

I've created my {{< var course.short >}} website - check it out!

https://YOUR_GITHUB_ID.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/
```

:::

(Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_ID` with your username throughout.)

![](../images/github_issue.png)

This will send me a notification through GitHub and I will confirm that I can
access your repository and website. You should also use the [course helper 
scripts](../tips.html) to verify you have opened a GitHub issue properly. For
this project, simply run: 


```{r}
#| eval: false
source("https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/load_helpers.R")
mp_submission_verify(0, "YOUR_GITHUB_ID")
```

If you don't do this, I may not be able to access your graded assignments when 
you submit them! 

[^sub]: Throughout this course, make sure to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_ID` with your 
recently created GitHub ID. Note
that the automated course infrastructure will be looking for precise formatting,
so follow these instructions closely. 

### Brightspace Submission

Finally, a PDF export of your home page should be submitted on Brightspace.
To create a PDF from the GitHub-hosted page, simply use your browser's 'Print to 
PDF' functionality and upload the resulting file to Brightspace. 

## Wrap-Up

Once I acknowledge receipt of your ID and website, you're done with 
Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}!
You've built a website and are ready for the course to begin in earnest. 

Mini-Projects #01-#04 will be submitted as separate pages in your website
(different `quarto` documents) and hosted via GitHub pages for peer feedback.
We will discuss that process in more detail after Mini-Project 
#{{< meta mp_num >}} is complete.

## Optional: Adding a Personal Image to your Site

Often, students will want to add a personal picture or professional headshot
to their page. This is a two is a two part process:

1.  Your picture needs to be somewhere public. If the picture just lives on your
    personal computer, website viewers won't be able to access it. (For very
    good and hopefully obvious safety reasons, you don't want everyone on the
    entire internet to have access to your files.)

    There are two public places it makes sense to host an image file: 

    a) You can place a copy of the picture in your GitHub repo, just like the
       docs/index.html file. This is recommended as it gives you total control
       over the image and lets you update or replace it easily. Alternatively,

    b) You can link to a picture hosted elsewhere.

    For option a), place a copy of the image file in the root directory of your
    site (`{{< var course.repo >}}`). When you render your site, a copy should be
    automatically created under the `docs/`. *E.g.*, if you have `headshot.png` 
    in the top level directory and used in your site, you should see
    `docs/headshot.png` created automatically by `quarto` when you re-render
    `index.qmd`. Once it is in the `docs`, just run it through the normal `git`
    steps (`add`, `commit`, `push`) and a copy will appear on GitHub. Note that
    it is important that a copy exist under `docs`: only files in the `docs`
    folder are actually accessible to the broad internet. 

    If, for whatever reason, `docs/headshot.png` is not automatically created,
    just manually copy the image into the `docs` folder.

    For option b), you just need the URL of where the image is hosted. You can
    usually get this by righ-clicking on the image and selecting "Open in a new
    Tab". The URL of the resulting tab will be what you want. Other sites,
    particularly those optimized for hosting content (like a Flickr or Imgur)
    will give you a specific "embedding URL" to use instead. While this option
    can be useful, some sites, *e.g.*, LinkedIn, do not allow you to embed
    images from their servers even if you were the one to originally download it.
    If this is the case, simply save a copy locally and go through option a)
    instead. 

2.  Once your image is public, you need to link to it. This is done with
    Markdown's `![](URL)` syntax. (Note the leading `!` - it’s important.)

    For an image hosted externally (option b), just put the full URL into the 
    URL slot. This needs to be everything from `http` all the way to the end.

    For an image hosted on your GitHub, you can use what's called a relative 
    link. If the image is in the right place, this is as simple as just using
    `headshot.png` for the URL, so the entire snippet to include is
    `![](headshot.png)` For more complex sites, you might want to store all your
    images in a folder and link to that folder, but that’s a bit more advanced
    and we’ll cover that sort of thing later in the course.

    After you’ve put in the link, hit Render to make sure it works and then do
    the `git add`, `commit`, `push` cycle. If the image works on your local
    computer but doesn’t appear on the hosted website and you instead get a
    missing image icon, be sure to check that you have a copy of the image in 
    your `docs` folder on GitHub. 


## Hints 

If you need help, the course discussion board should be your first stop. 

If you want to personalize your website further, you can see how I have created
mine on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelweylandt/michaelweylandt.github.io). 
Recall that the Markdown syntax used by `quarto` is summarized at
[https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

You may want to use the [About
Page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html)
functionality to improve the look of your home page. This gives you the ability
to link to your social media (personal and professional) or personal blog, to
include a professional headshot, *etc.*

[^1]: Early in the course, I will 'scaffold' most of the analysis, leaving only
some small steps for you to fill in. As the course progresses, the mini-projects
will be more self-directed. 

[^2]: Alternatively, simply go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) after
logging in.

[^3]: You can leave the next two boxes blank or set a custom directory name and 
location. RStudio's defaults are reasonable; the default directory name will 
simply be `{{< var course.repo >}}` and it will be located in your home 
directory. 

[^4]: If you choose to complete the course using a pseudonym, make up 
something fun. If you are using your real name, this is a great place to state 
that you are a Baruch student, your expected graduation date, your field of 
employment (current or desired), and one or two personal facts. This, along 
with a LinkedIn page, will quickly become one of the first things that comes up 
when a potential employer searches your name, so make a good impression!
