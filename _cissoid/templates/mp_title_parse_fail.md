Hi @{{ gh }},

Thank you for your submission to STA 9750. 

I cannot parse the title of your submission. Per the instructions for [Mini-Project #0{{project_id}}](https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/mini/mini0{{project_id}}.html), 
I expected an issue with the title: 

> `STA 9750 {{gh}} MiniProject #0{{project_id}}`

which differs from the title you used (`{{current_title}}`). 

Please edit the title of this issue to conform to the desired format. (Note that
there is a large green "Edit" button to the right of the issue title at the top
of this page that you can use to edit the title. You do not need to open a new
issue.)

Thanks,
