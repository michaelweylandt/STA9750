## Life Tip of the Week

West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (March 11, 1943)

. . . 

Students cannot be compelled to recite the Pleldge of Allegiance, 
even during a period of war

*Iconic First Amendment Victory*

## Barnette

Justice Jackson's Opinion (6-3):

> If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no
  official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,
  nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to
  confess by word or act their faith therein.

## Story Behind the Case

1940 Case *Minersville School District v. Gobitis* 

- JW Students in PA refused to recite Pledge of Allegience

. . . 

Justice Frankfurter (8-1 Majority Opinion):

> National Unity is the basis of National Security

Students **could be forced** to pledge

. . . 

</br>

After the decision, waves of violence against JW students and
adults accused of "treason" against the war effort

## Story Behind the Case

Justice Stone (Dissent): 

> [T]he guarantees of civil liberty are but guarantees of freedom of the human mind and spirit and of reasonable freedom and opportunity to express them. [... T]he very essence of the liberty which they guarantee is the freedom of the individual from compulsion as to what he shall think and what he shall say.

. . . 

A few years later, changed court wanted to revisit, 
leading to *Barnette*

## More from J. Jackson

> As governmental pressure toward unity becomes greater, so strife becomes more bitter as to whose unity it shall be.[...] Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard. 

. . . 

> Authority [in the United States] is to be controlled by public opinion, not public opinion by authority.

## More from J. Jackson

> [F]reedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order. 

## Lessons

- We get things wrong, often very wrong, in times 
  of public fear
  
. . . 

- Law of Free Speech is necessary but not sufficient for a 
  Culture of Free Speech 
  
. . . 

- Freedom to Dissent is at the core of a pluralistic society

. . . 

- Rules and norms exist for the hard cases, not the easy ones
