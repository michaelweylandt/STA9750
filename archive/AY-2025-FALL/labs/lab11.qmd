# Review Practice {#review}

The [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) provides a simple API for
trivia questions. You are going to use this API to create a trivia game for
you and some friends. 

0. Before beginning, explore [the question bank](https://opentdb.com/browse.php)
   and the [API call generator](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to
   understand the types of data available and the structure of the API call.
1. Use the API call generator to create a URL to download 5 multiple-choice 
   questions on a topic of your choosing. Copy this URL. 
2. Now, use the `httr2` package in `R` to make a request to that URL. At first,
   simply paste the whole URL into `request` and confirm it works. Then, break
   the URL into its constitutent parts using the `req_url_path()` and 
   `req_url_query()` functions to construct the URL. (We won't be parametrizing
   the API call in this brief exercise, but this is important to do if you are
   going to programmatically be making several API calls.)
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr2)
req1 <- request("https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=50&category=18&type=multiple") 

# Decompose the URL into its various components: 
req2 <- request("https://opentdb.com") |>
          req_url_path("api.php") |>
          req_url_query(amount   = 50, 
                        category = 18, 
                        type     = "multiple")

# Confirm equivalence
all.equal(req1, req2)
```

I'm using Computer Science (Category 18) but you can use others. 

Now that we have built our request objects, we can use `req_perform()` to actually
make the request: 

```{r}
resp <- req2 |> req_perform()
resp
```

:::

3. The default response format is `json`, so use the `resp_body_json` function
   to convert the response into `R`. Print the repsonse to screen and examine
   the format. This will help you know what you need to do to manipulate 
   ("rectangle") the data into a useful structure. 
   
   *Hint:* To avoid printing so much to screen that it's hard to make sense of
   the output, you may wish to modify your API call to temporarily only request
   3-5 responses, instead of 50, even if your eventual goal is to get more
   responses than that.
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}


```{r}
#| cache: true
request("https://opentdb.com") |>
          req_url_path("api.php") |>
          req_url_query(amount   = 3, 
                        category = 18, 
                        type     = "multiple") |>
    # Some stuff to respect API rate limiting
    req_throttle(capacity=2) |>
    req_retry(max_tries = 5) |>
    req_perform() |>
    resp_body_json() |>
    str()
```

We see here that the response comes in a list of two components: `response_code`
and `results`, with the content we want being in the `results`. The 3 `results`
look pretty straightforward, except for the `incorrect_answers` list, which
we will need to keep an eye on. 

:::

4. Use the `pluck` function to extract the relevant part of the JSON response.
   The response will have several similarly formatted response objects. Use the
   `map(as_tibble) |> list_rbind()` paradigm to convert these into a large data
   frame. 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
#| cache: true
request("https://opentdb.com") |>
    req_url_path("api.php") |>
    req_url_query(amount   = 3, 
                  category = 18, 
                  type     = "multiple") |>
    # Some stuff to respect API rate limiting
    req_throttle(capacity=2) |>
    req_retry(max_tries = 5) |>
    req_perform() |>
    resp_body_json() |>
    pluck("results") |>
    map(as_tibble) |>
    list_rbind()
```

Everything looks pretty good here, with two notes: 

- The `incorrect_answers` column appears to be a `list` type column
- Each of our responses was repeated across three rows. 

:::

5. Use the `unnest` and `pivot_wider` functions to conver this data into a 
   more usable structure. 
   
   When applied to a `list` column, the `unnest` function will try to convert
   it into a more standard vector-type column. 
   
   *Hint*: Before using `pivot_wider`, you will need to create a new column with
   column names for the pivoted data. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
#| cache: true
request("https://opentdb.com") |>
    req_url_path("api.php") |>
    req_url_query(amount   = 3, 
                  category = 18, 
                  type     = "multiple") |>
    # Some stuff to respect API rate limiting
    req_throttle(capacity=2) |>
    req_retry(max_tries = 5) |>
    req_perform() |>
    resp_body_json() |>
    pluck("results") |>
    map(as_tibble) |>
    list_rbind() |>
    unnest(incorrect_answers) |>
    group_by(question) |>
    mutate(pivot_name = paste0("incorrect-", row_number())) |>
    pivot_wider(names_from = pivot_name, 
                values_from = incorrect_answers) |>
    select(-type, 
           -category, 
           -difficulty)
```

You can use this to play a bit of trivia amongst your group. Set `amount` 
higher for more questions.

# Web Scraping

In today's class, we're going to work through **three** web scraping exercises: 

1) Reading a simple static table
2) Extending our 'CUNY Map' from [Lab #01](./lab01.html)
3) Scraping Cocktail Recipes 🍸 from Hadley Wickham

## Exercise 1: Reading HTML Tables {#ex01}

Using `rvest`, read the following table into `R`. Your results should be a 
data frame that captures the structure of the table.

: Selected Statistics Courses Offered at Baruch College {#tbl-baruch-stats}

1) Use the Selector Gadget or similar to identify the HTML elements defining
   this table. You can do this in one of two ways: 
   
   - By a specific named element, accessed as `html_element("#name")`
   - By a specific element type, accessed as `html_element("type")`
   
2) Use the `read_html` function to read this entire page into `R`, then use
   the `html_element` function with the selector from the previous step to
   extract the table. 
   
3) Use the `html_table` function to conver this table into a data frame. 

This page is pretty simple, so a little bit of element selection and 
`html_table` will suffice. For more complex tables, you may need to do more to
select the specific table and more to 'clean up' that table once it is in `R`.

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(rvest)
read_html("https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/labs/lab11.html") |>
    html_element("#tbl-baruch-stats") |> 
    html_table()

# OR - Since this page has only a single table
read_html("https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/labs/lab11.html") |>
    html_element("table") |> 
    html_table()
```

:::

## Exercise 2: CUNY Map {#ex02}

In this exercise, we're going to take our Baruch map from 
[Lab #01](./lab01.html) and extend it to pull _all_ CUNY campuses. 
This exercise is intended to help you practice scraping data from 
Wikipedia, which is a good example of a relatively plain HTML site that has a
bit of extra Javascript that can make it a bit tricky to find the element(s)
you want. 

The following code is a cleaned-up version of the map creation activity from 
Lab #01. Review it before beginning this activity: 

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(leaflet)

baruch_info <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College") |> 
    html_element(".geo") |> 
    html_text() |> 
    str_split_1(";") |> 
    as.numeric() |> 
    set_names(c("latitude", "longitude")) |> 
    bind_rows()

leaflet() |>
    addTiles() |>
    setView(lat = baruch_info$latitude, 
            lng = baruch_info$longitude, 
            zoom=17) |>
    addPopups(lat = baruch_info$latitude, 
              lng = baruch_info$longitude, 
               "Look! It's <b>Baruch College</b>!") |>
    print()
```

1) Building on the code above, write a function that takes the Wikipedia URL for a
   CUNY as an argument and returns a data frame with two columns: 
   
   - Latitude
   - Longitude

   Confirm that your function works by applying it to Baruch's Wikipedia page. 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
get_cuny_coordinates <- function(url){
    read_html(url) |> 
        html_element(".geo") |> 
        html_text() |> 
        str_split_1(";") |> 
        as.numeric() |> 
        set_names(c("latitude", "longitude")) |> 
        bind_rows()
}

get_cuny_coordinates("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College")
```

:::

2) Investigate the [Wikipedia List of
   CUNYs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_City_University_of_New_York_institutions)
   and identify which table can be used to get links to each CUNY's page.  
   
::: {.callout-caution title="Wikipedia Table Scraping"}

Wikipedia has tons of excellent data tables which have been collected
by incredible volunteers. It can be an incredibly useful source, but
there are a few difficulties in getting data out of Wikipedia. In
particular, Wikipedia uses a rich JavaScript library to make tables
slightly interactive (column sorting, *etc.*) that modifies the page
HTML. `R` will get the "raw" HTML of the page, so you will need to
either disable JavaScript temporarily (tricky) or make sure you are
looking at the actual page source that `R` will see ("View Source"). 

As a general rule, try to use standard HTML elements (`table`, `tbody`) instead
of fancier alternatives when possible. 

:::

3) Parse the table to pull links to each CUNY's individual Wikipedia
   page. 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}  
CUNYs <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_City_University_of_New_York_institutions") |> 
    html_element("tbody") |>
    html_elements("tr td:nth-child(2)") |>
    html_elements("a") 

CUNYs <- tibble(name = CUNYs |> html_text(), 
                link = CUNYs |> html_attr("href"))
```

If you are comfortable with the `purrr` family of functions, this can be
written a bit more compactly as:

```{r}   
CUNYs <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_City_University_of_New_York_institutions") |> 
    html_element("tbody") |>
    html_elements("tr td:nth-child(2)") |>
    html_elements("a") |> 
    map(\(tr) tibble(name = tr |> html_text(), 
                     link = tr |> html_attr("href"))) |> 
    bind_rows()
```

:::

4) Modify the links extracted from the Wikipedia table to form full URLs.

   Proper URL handling is a bit subtle - it's a common avenue for security holes
   - but a simple `paste0` will suffice here. 
 
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
   
```{r}
CUNYs <- CUNYs |> mutate(link = paste0("https://en.wikipedia.org", link))
```

:::

4) Apply your HTML parsing function from Step 1 to each CUNY page
   using the `map` function or the `rowwise()` grouping structure: 
   
   *Hint*: You may need to use `unnest` to convert a list column into something
   more usable. 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
   
```{r}
#| cache: true
CUNYs <- CUNYs |> rowwise() |> mutate(info = get_cuny_coordinates(link))
## Or with `map`
CUNYs <- CUNYs |> mutate(info = map(link, get_cuny_coordinates))

## Then unnest the info column

CUNYs <- CUNYs |> unnest(info)

CUNYs
```

:::   
   
5) Use your results to build a CUNY-wide map

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
   
```{r}
MAP <- leaflet() |> 
    addTiles() |> 
    addMarkers(lng = CUNYs$longitude, 
               lat=CUNYs$latitude, 
               popup=CUNYs$name)

MAP
```

:::   

## Exercise 3: Cocktails Data {#ex03}

[Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/) is the author of many of the 
"tidy tools" we use in this course. He is also an excellent bartender
and chef. In this exercise, we are going to web scrape his cocktail
recipe book which can be found at <https://cocktails.hadley.nz/>. 

Our goal is to create a data frame that records all 150+ recipes on this site 
(as rows) and the different ingredients (as columns). This
week, we are going to pull the different recipes into `R`: next week
we are going to process the text and create our final data frame (so
stay tuned!). 

Working with your project team, first go through the following steps to build
a scraping strategy:

1) Poke around the website to see how it is organized. Is there a
   single page listing all of the cocktails? If not, how else can
   you make sure that you've explored the entire site?
2) Once you know how you're going to explore the whole site, use
   your browser tools to see if you can identify an HTML element that
   corresponds to a single recipe. (This element will occur several
   times per page) Remember that you want to select "as small as
   possible" but no smaller.
3) Once you have found the right HTML element for a recipe, identify
   an HTML element that corresponds to i) the title; and ii) individual
   ingredients. 
   
For this task, you will likely see several recipes more than once.
Don't worry about this for now - we can `distinct` out the duplicates
later in our analysis. It's better to be over-inclusive than
under-inclusive.
   
After you have built your plan, it's time to start putting this all to
code. 

1) Write code to get a list of all pages you will need to process. Construct 
   full URLs for your future requests. 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr2)
library(rvest)

BASE_URL <- "https://cocktails.hadley.nz/"

PAGES <- read_html(BASE_URL) |> 
            html_elements("nav a") |> 
            html_attr("href")

PAGE_URLS <- paste0(BASE_URL, PAGES)


PAGE_URLS
```

:::

2) Write a function that takes a single URL and extracts all recipes on that
   page as HTML elements. 
   
   Try this out on a fixed URL and confirm that it gets the right number of
   recipes

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr2)
library(rvest)
get_recipes <- function(url){
    read_html(url) |> html_elements("article")
}
```   

We can test this [against this page](https://cocktails.hadley.nz/tag-bubbles.html)
and see that it works as expected: 

```{r}
BUBBLES <- get_recipes("https://cocktails.hadley.nz/tag-bubbles.html")

BUBBLES
```

:::

3) Write a function that takes in a single recipe and returns a small data 
   frame with the title and ingredients: 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr2)
library(rvest)
process_recipe <- function(art){
    title <- art |> html_element(".title") |> html_text2()
    ingredients <- art |> html_elements("li") |> html_text2()
    
    tibble(title=title, ingredients=ingredients)
}
```  

We can again test this using the recipes we extracted above: 

```{r}
process_recipe(BUBBLES[[1]])
```

:::

4) Write a function that combines your results from the previous two steps to
   build a data frame with _all_ recipes on a single page. 
   
   Try this out on a fixed URL and confirm it works as expected. 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr2)
library(rvest)

process_url <- function(url){
    html_recipes <- get_recipes(url)
    
    RECIPES <- data.frame()
    
    for(r in html_recipes){
        RECIPES <- rbind(RECIPES, process_recipe(r))
    }
    
    RECIPES
}
```

We can test this on the page of bubbly recipes: 

```{r}
process_url("https://cocktails.hadley.nz/tag-bubbles.html")
```

:::
   
5) Use your function from the first step with the list of URLs from Step 1 so
   that you get all of the recipes on the site. Combine your results into one
   large data frame that looks something like:
   
   | Name     | Ingredient           |
   |----------|----------------------|
   | Daiquiri | 2 oz Rum             | 
   | Daiquiri | 1 oz Lime Juice      | 
   | Daiquiri | 0.75 oz Simple Syrup |

   To be polite, you may want to add `req_cache` to your requests so you are not
   requesting the same page many times over. 
   
::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr2)
library(rvest)

ALL_RECIPES <- data.frame()

for(page in PAGE_URLS){
    ALL_RECIPES <- rbind(ALL_RECIPES, process_url(page))
}

ALL_RECIPES
```

:::

6) Save your code for next week. Next week we will investigate string processing
   and learn how to turn a table like: 
   
   | Name     | Ingredient           |
   |----------|----------------------|
   | Daiquiri | 2 oz Rum             | 
   | Daiquiri | 1 oz Lime Juice      | 
   | Daiquiri | 0.75 oz Simple Syrup |
   
   into 

   | Name     | Ingredient   | Amount  |
   |----------|--------------|---------|
   | Daiquiri | Rum          | 2       |
   | Daiquiri | Lime Juice   | 1       |
   | Daiquiri | Simple Syrup | 0.75    |


::: {.callout-caution title="FP Solution" collapse="true"}

If you are comfortable with (or want to become comfortable with) the functional
programming tools of `purrr`, you can write this entire analysis in one swoop:

```{r}
#| cache: true
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
process_recipe <- function(recipe){
    title <- recipe |> html_element(".title") |> html_text2()
    ingredients <- recipe |> html_elements("li") |> html_text2()
    
    tibble(title=title, ingredients=ingredients)
}

BASE_URL <- "https://cocktails.hadley.nz/"

read_html(BASE_URL) |> 
    html_elements("nav a") |> 
    html_attr("href") |>
    map(\(p) request(BASE_URL) |> req_url_path(p)) |>
    map(req_perform) |>
    map(resp_body_html) |> 
    map(html_elements, "article") |> 
    reduce(c) |>
    map(process_recipe) |> 
    list_rbind()
```

This is clearly quite terse and would benefit from some additional comments,
but I'm omitting them so you can try to deconstruct this code yourself if 
you want to practice functional programming idioms.
