Topics: 

- Installing `R` and `RStudio`
- Installing `git`
- Getting Started on `GitHub`
- Basic Principles of "Clean Code"

## `R` and `RStudio`

The primary programming language used in this course is `R`, one of the two
most popular languages used in data science. `R`, like its predecessor the
`S` language, is optimized for *interactive*, *data-analytic* work, in contrast
with `python`, which is optimized for general purpose computing. 

`R` is a programming *language* and *runtime*; we will supplement it with `RStudio`, 
an *Integrated Development Environment* or, less formally, an *editor*. `RStudio` 
is the software where you will **write** the code and then the `R` runtime will
**execute** it. 

### `R`

Students should first install `R` from [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

[![Don't fear the 90's web design! Click image for detailed installation instructions.](../images/rproj_home.png)](https://vimeo.com/203516510 "R Installation Tutorial!")


As of 2025-08-26, the most recent version of `R` is **4.5.1**. Using the most current
version of `R` will reduce the likelihood of issues later in the course.

### `RStudio`

Next, download and install the [`RStudio` IDE (desktop edition)](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

[![Click image for detailed installation instructions.](../images/rstudio_home.png)](https://vimeo.com/203516968 "RStudio Installation Tutorial!")


`RStudio` is highly configurable and I recommend taking advantage of all its 
built-in features. If you go to the `Global Options` menu (accessible under 
`Tools`[^tools_menu]), I recommend the following settings:

- General: Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup".
- General: Set "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to "Never"
- Code / Editing: Set "Tab width" to 2
- Code / Editing: Check
  - "Insert spaces for Tab"
  - Auto-detect code indentation
  - Insert matching parens / quotes
  - Use native pipe operator
  - Auto-indent code after paste
  - Vertically align arguments in auto-indent
  - Continue comment when inserting new line
- Code / Display: Check
  - Show line numbers
  - Show margin (margin column should be 80)
- Code / Diagnostics:  check all "R" diagnostics.
- Appearance: Pick a color theme you enjoy. (I'm partial to light text on 
  a dark background)
  
[^tools_menu]: On a Mac, the `Global Options >> Tools` menu is available at 
the same place you’ll find options for almost all Mac software: along the very 
top bar of the screen when you are in the relevant app. If you don’t see this 
bar, you need to exit full screen mode. Note that this is a Mac-wide way of
displaying and hiding menus, and is not specific to `RStudio`. On a Windows
machine, the tools are usually located near the top of the RStudio window, not
near the top of the entire display.

    ![](../images/rstudio_options.png)
  
You may wish to enable GitHub Copilot. I have little experience with GH Copilot, 
but it seems quite popular and is allowed in this course. It is not guaranteed to be
accurate at all times - and "the AI told me to" is not a valid excuse if your code is 
wrong - but on balance, it should be useful.

### `quarto`

We won't use it this week, but you will need to install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
before starting on [Mini-Project #00](../miniprojects/mini00.html), so if you
have a moment, I'd recommend doing it now.

## Code Styling

### Autoformatting with the `styler` Package

A major theme of this course will be sharing and co-developing code with your
classmates, both for peer feedback and for the course project. Code sharing is hard!
Everyone writes code a little differently and what is clear to you may not be clear
at all to your reader. 

To make code sharing just a bit easier, we use tools to ensure all code shared
in this course is consistently formatted. By using consistent formatting, you
reduce the cognitive load on your reader, making it easier for them to focus on
the *ideas* of your code, not how you chose to write it. 

A major strength of `R` is its huge number of user-contributed *packages*. These are
"add-ins" which provide additional functionality not available in the basic 
version of `R`. 

As of 2025-09-25, there are over [22 thousand
packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) available
on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), the largest official repository of 
`R` packages. Beyond all those, there are thousands more packages available on 
other code hosting websites like `GitHub`.[^2]

We will use the contributed `styler` package to format code in this course. 
Run the following command to automatically download and install the `styler` 
package: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("styler")
```

(Use the clipboard icon on the right of code snippets to automatically copy code suitable
for pasting into `RStudio`.)

You should see something like this: 

![](../images/styler_install.png)

The `styler` package has been downloaded and installed on your computer, but it is not
yet "active" or "open" in `R`. In general, you will only need to _download_ packages
once, but you will need to _load_ them each time you want to use them.[^3]

Open a `R` file, sometimes called an `R` script file, in `RStudio` and copy 
the following (ugly) code: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
if(!require("leaflet")) install.packages("leaflet")
if(!require("tidyverse")){
    install.packages("tidyverse")
   }
 library(tidyverse)
     library(rvest)
library(leaflet)

pAGE = read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College')
  pAGE |> html_element(".latitude") |> html_text2() -> BaruchLatitude
  baruch_longitude <- pAGE |> html_element(".longitude") |> html_text2()
  
    BaruchLatitude <- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(BaruchLatitude, 
                                     "[^0123456789]")[[1]]) * (1/60)^(0:2), na.rm=TRUE)
 baruch_longitude <- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(baruch_longitude, "[^0123456789]")[[1]]) * 
                             (1/60)^(0:2), na.rm=TRUE)
  
leaflet() |>
addTiles() |>
    setView(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, 
               zoom=17) |>
    addPopups(-baruch_longitude,
              BaruchLatitude, "Look! It's <b>Baruch College</b>!") |>
print()
```

You don't need to understand what this does just yet, but it's hopefully clear 
that this is _ugly_ code. Nothing is lined up properly, capitalization is 
erratic, and different coding styles are intermixed rather recklessly. 

::: {.callout-warning}

If you run this code and get a `Warning` message, don't worry about it for now. Warnings occur when your code runs, but something 'smelled funny'. At this point, we're only worrying about an `Error` message. 

:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Map not Appearing"}

If the code runs (with `Warning`) but does not produce a plot, 
try clicking on the arrow next to the `Source` button and hitting
`Source with Echo`. This will force `R` to print the result of
the code, *i.e.*, to generate the plot.

:::

Near the top of your `RStudio` pane, you will see a drop-down menu titled `Addins`. 
If you successfully installed `styler` above, one of the `Addins` choices will be
"style active file." Click this and the code will be cleaned up (a bit) resulting
in something like this: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require("leaflet")) install.packages("leaflet")
if (!require("tidyverse")) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(leaflet)

pAGE <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College")
pAGE |>
  html_element(".geo") |>
  html_text2() |>
  str_split_1(";") -> BaruchLatitude
baruch_longitude <- pAGE |>
  html_element(".longitude") |>
  html_text2()

BaruchLatitude <- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(
  BaruchLatitude,
  "[^0123456789]"
)[[1]]) * (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)
baruch_longitude <- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(baruch_longitude, "[^0123456789]")[[1]]) *
  (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)

leaflet() |>
     addTiles() |> 
     setView(-baruch_longitude, 
             BaruchLatitude, 
             zoom = 17) |>
     addPopups(-baruch_longitude, 
               BaruchLatitude, 
               "Look! It's <b>Baruch College</b>!") |>
     print()
```

It's far from perfect - and we will discuss the *many* issues in this example throughout
the course - but it's better! At a minimum, you should make sure to run `styler`
like this on all code you submit during this course. 

And now that your code is cleaned up, you should run it! The `Source` button in the top
right corner will run all code in the open file. Running the code produces something
like this: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Tell R where to download packages
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

# Install necessary packages
if (!require("leaflet")) install.packages("leaflet")
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(leaflet)

pAGE <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College")
pAGE |>
  html_element(".latitude") |>
  html_text2() -> BaruchLatitude
baruch_longitude <- pAGE |>
  html_element(".longitude") |>
  html_text2()

BaruchLatitude <- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(
  BaruchLatitude,
  "[^0123456789]"
)[[1]]) * (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)
baruch_longitude <- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(baruch_longitude, "[^0123456789]")[[1]]) *
  (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)

leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(-baruch_longitude, 
          BaruchLatitude, 
          zoom = 17) |>
  addPopups(-baruch_longitude, 
            BaruchLatitude, 
            "Look! It's <b>Baruch College</b>!") |>
  print()
```


Not too shabby! That's an *interactive*, *dynamic* map showing the location 
of Baruch College obtained by parsing the [Baruch Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College), 
getting the GPS coordinates of Baruch, downloading a map file, and locating 
Baruch on that map. 

**Challenge**: Adjust this code to show _Hunter_ college instead of Baruch.

::: {.callout-note title="More than you ever wanted to know about file types" collapse=true}

All the files we use in this course (with very rare exceptions) are some sort 
of _text file_ in the sense that they are 'just' letters in a file. This can be
distinguished from file types that contain both text and lots of additional
formatting and structure (*e.g.*, a Word document) or are something entirely
non-textual (like a picture or a video).

Text files (in this broad sense) are powerful and useful because their 
simplicity makes them usable and editable by almost anything. You could start 
writing a file in RStudio, close it and open it in Notepad, make some edits and 
then close and re-open in another IDE like VSCode, and then final re-open in MS 
Word without issues. As long as you keep it as a text file -- and don't let Word 
secretly turn it into a Word document behind your back[^wordconv] -- you maintain
full interoperability. 

[^wordconv]: If you open a non-`docx` file in Word and edit it, Word will give 
you a scary warning message about 'loosing features' if you don't convert to a 
MS Word format. That message is more of a scare tactic to get you to only use 
  Word and avoid other software than anything you should actually credit.

You should distinguish this from something non-plain text like a PDF document. 
We've all had the example of a PDF looking differently on your machine than 
your friend's, and not being able to make the edits you want to a PDF unless you
pay for a specific piece of expensive software, or having the ability to include
videos if you use Adobe Acrobat, but not if you use the PDF viewer built into 
your browser.  This is because a PDF is a complex file format that requires 
special software to use it and not all software implements everything the exact
same way. 

A plain text file is sufficiently simple that essentially any software can do 
anything to it. Because a text file is 'just' letters, you can put anything in
there: 

- R Code
- Python Code
- Simple Notes or SMS (text) messages
- Even something as complex as a [plain text
  spreadsheet](https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Spreadsheet.html). This last one 
  is admittedly a bit obscure and really only appeals to plain-text obsessives.

So then how does software know what to make of a particular plain text file? 

This is where file _extensions_ come in: _extensions_ don't change the contents
of a file, they are just a naming convention. But we all agree that if a file is
called `filename.R`, the text in it should be interpreted as `R` code; a
different file called `filename.py` should be interpreted as python code. You
could put R code in a `.py` file and it would still be a file, but when you 
then started up Python instead of R, you'd get all sorts of errors.[^pyr] 

File extensions naming conventions are purely _social_ conventions. But social 
conventions are powerful!

When you ask `R` studio to open a `.R` file, it _assumes_ you're going to do
"R things" with it. And so it gives you buttons to "Run" or "Source" the code
by default; those buttons are hooked up to the R interpreter, the actual
software that does 'R things'.  These buttons aren't inherent to the file or 
hidden in its contents anywhere: the buttons are only added by RStudio as it
tries to be as helpful as possible.   

If you instead ask RStudio to open a `.py` file, it will presnet you 
some python-related buttons by default. And if you ask RStudio to open a 
`.qmd` file, it will give you buttons to "Render" default. 

So any plain text file can theoretically be anything. It's just the file 
extension gives RStudio a hint as to what to you're going to do with and 
RStudio uses that hint to (try to) be helpful to you. At the time of file 
_creation_ (*i.e.*, the New File menu), RStudio can't get this social clue 
from the file name since it's never been saved and no filename exists, so it
asks you directly. 

If you open a file in RStudio and want it to be treated differently, you can
click the little text in the bottom right of the file. If you start with an `.R`
file (or the "R Script" new file menu), this will say R Script. If you instead
change that to something like "Quarto", you'll see the buttons at the top change
to the Quarto related buttons. In doing this, you're not actually _changing_ the
file, you're just telling RStudio to give you different tools for working with
that file. 

So what does this mean for you in this class?

- Everything we'll do in this class is some sort of 'plain text file'
- All plain text files are internally the same - we just add social conventions
  around them based on their names and extensions (`test.R` vs `test.qmd` vs 
  `test.txt`)
- RStudio knows these social conventions and tries to play along, but can be 
  overruled. 

So, the right file type reflects what you want to do: 

- if you're using this code for just plain R code and nothing else, you want
  `RStudio` to interpret it as an `R Script` and you should proceed accordingly,
  by naming it `filename.R` and by using the "R Script" type when creating a new
  file. If you're saving a new file of this type, RStudio will encourage (but
  not insist) you save it as `.R` to convey your intention to your future self
  and RStudio when it re-opens the file later. 

- If you want to write a Quarto document and have the ability to mix in code and
  text, with the goal of producing a 'document' output (e.g., a web page or a
  PDF), you should make sure your file is named `filename.qmd` (if it already
  exists) or create it by using the "Quarto Document" type in the new file menu. 

- If you want to write a document that is _just text to be read by a human and
  no other purpose_ (e.g., a personal TODO list or a draft of an email before
  you copy it into Outlook), the social convention is that this is either a
  `.txt` file _or_ a file with no extension at all (like `README`). Somewhat
  confusingly, this particular social convention is also called a "text file" in
  the narrow sense of being _English language text_, as distinct from the "text
  file" in the sense of being letters and not binary code or photos I've been
  using up to this point. The RStudio new file menu will call this a "Text File"
  and will default to saving it as a `.txt` file. 


[^pyr]: It is theoretically possible to have a bit of code that is so simple, it
    is both valid `R` code and `python` code. In that case, you could try to run
    that file in `R` and in `python` and everything would be ok. As far as the 
    `R` software or the `python` software care, it's _just_ text. It only 
    becomes code when the `R` software or the `python` software try to use it 
    as code. 

    For example, a file that contains only these lines

    ```{md}
    print(hello)
    ```

    could be run with `R` to produce the output:

    ```{md}
    % Rscript test.txt
    [1] "Hello!"
    ```

    If we instead run the same file with the `python` command, we would get
    similar (but not quite identical) output:

    ```{md}
    % python test.txt
    Hello!
    ```

    But this is a sort of trivial example that doesn't extend to software that
    does anything actually interesting.

:::

### `lintr` 

If you want even more feedback on writing good code, install the `lintr` package
and use the associated `RStudio` add-in. Unlike `styler`, `lintr` won't make changes
_automatically_ for you, but it will highlight much more subtle _possible_ problems.[^6]


## Source Code Management

### `git`

`git` is a **source-code management** tool, used by developers to manage the code
they write. If you've ever been part of a large project and struggled to coordinate
all team members using the same version of a document, `git` exists to solve that problem.

If you don't have `git` pre-installed, install either 
[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or the XCode Command Line
Tools for MacOS[^gitmac] as appropriate.

[^gitmac]: XCode is a bundle of useful software development tools that Apple
makes available for anyone using a Mac. One of those tools is `git`, so this
makes XCode the "most official" way to install `git` on a Mac. If you click on
the "Terminal" tab in RStudio (just to the right of "Console" in the bottom left
quadrant) and type:

    > `git`
    
    Note that this must be run at a **Mac command line**, not at the `R` 
    console. The *command line* is direct control of the operating system 
    itself, while the `R` console is just for controlling `R`. Within `RStudio`,
    you can access the command line by clicking on the `Terminal` tab, located
    near the `Console` tab. 

    After running `git`, you will be able to determine if `git` is already
    installed. If `git` is installed, you will receive either a long-ish help
    message telling you how to use `git` or a status message for your current
    `git` repository. Either of these means you already have `git` installed.

    If `git` is not installed, recent-ish Macs usually will offer to install `git`
    for you when you try to run it. A pop-up window will appear and ask if you
    want to install XCode. XCode contains many tools and is a bit large, so this
    installation may take over an hour. If, for whatever reason, the pop up menu
    does not appear, simply run

    > `xcode-select --install`

    at the `Terminal` and it will install XCode (including `git`) for you. You
    may need to type your computer password here. If you are working in a 
    terminal and no letters appear when start to type your password, don't worry:
    that is just a standard security precaution.

In this course, we will use three main functions of `git`: 

- **staging**: telling `git`, I want you to prepare to save a certain file
- **committing**: saving a set of related changes
- **pushing**: copying your committed changes to a separate server for sharing and backup

Whenever you write code you are happy with, you should use `git` to save it. Saving
changes with `git` is cheap and easy - so do it regularly. You always want `git`
to have a backup of good code in case you loose power, accidentally delete a file, 
break something in a way you're not sure how to undo, *etc.*. 

`RStudio` comes with powerful `git` integration. Once you have created a _project_, 
you should see a tab labelled "Git" in the top right corner of your IDE window that
looks something like this: 

![](../images/git_pane_nostage.png)

For this semester, you should create a project called `{{< var course.repo >}}`. It is *very important* that you copy this name
exactly and maintain both the hyphens and the capitalization. 
All work for this course will live within this
project. We will discuss the use of projects in more detail in
[Mini-Project #00](../miniprojects/mini00.html).

To **stage** a file - prepare to save it - click the empty check box next to the file name. 
A new file shows a status of "?" - this is `git` saying "I've never seen this file 
before. Do you want me to track it for you?". Later, when you make further changes to file
you have already asked git to track, a status of "M" (for **M**odified) will be shown. 

On its own _staging_ a file does nothing. You also need to _commit_ it for `git` to
truly track it.[^5] The `Commit` button will commit all _staged_ changes. When you 
make a commit, `git` requires a brief message summarizing the changes. There's no
particular formatting requirement to this message, but it should be something that
future-you is able to easily understand. For instance, the commit message from the
initial draft of this document reads as: 

```
Initial draft of Lab 01 (STA9750)

- Installing R and RStudio
- Git and GitHub
- Leaflet Example for Styler

TODO: Fuller shell explainers
TODO: Link more git help
```

When I read this, I know the purpose of the change I made (first line), the
contents of that change (list), and parts that still need more work. 

Finally, after you save a change, it is only saved on your computer. The true power
of `git` comes from its ability to copy changes and backups across machines. This
gives you an easy way to store backups in case your computer dies and makes collaboration
efficient and fun. `git` allows you to `push` and `pull` changes between machines
in endlessly powerful (but sometimes complex) ways. For this course, we'll keep
things simple and only use `GitHub` to share code. We discuss `GitHub` in the next
section.


**Reference**: We will not use all of the functionality of `git` in this course, but
you should familiarize yourself with Chapters 1, 2, and 6 of the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
over the next two weeks.


### `GitHub`

`GitHub` is an industry-standard code hosting and collaboration platform. In addition
to hosting copies of code, `GitHub` provides web hosting, bug reporting, code review, 
continuous integration, documentation wikis, and discussion fora. You will explore
`GitHub` in more detail starting in [Mini-Project #00](../miniprojects/mini00.html).

## Extra: Welcome to $SHELL

To become a true "power user" of tools like `R` and `python`, you will need to 
become more familiar with the command line interface (CLI) and associated tools.[^4]

The [Software Carpentry Unix Shell Tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/aio.html)
is a great introduction to shell usage. Check it out!

**NB**: MacOS and Linux systems work quite similarly under the hood, as both descend
from the `Unix` tradition. By contrast, Windows works somewhat differently. Learners
whose personal machine runs Windows are encouraged to take advantage of the provided
Linux-running virtual machines[^1] as they work through this section.

## Looking Ahead

Next week, we will use these tools to begin coding in earnest. If you're feeling
ambitious, go ahead and get started on [Mini-Project #00](../miniprojects/mini00.html).

[^1]: See the [Course Resources](../resources.html) page.

[^2]: If you are interested in bioinformatics, the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)
project develops incredible open-source `R` packages.

[^3]: While this may feel cumbersome, it's really not dissimilar to any other
software you use (or `R` itself). You need to download it once, but you need to
open it each time you intend to use it. There's no harm in re-downloading--free software!--but
it wastes time and bandwidth. Since we benefit so much from the free-software community,
the very least we can do is not run up their internet bills unnecessarily. 

[^4]: As an added benefit, use of the CLI also makes you look like a 90s movie hacker to all
your friends.

[^5]: This two stage process is a bit cumbersome for the first stage of a small project, 
but it quickly becomes incredibly valuable. Instead of saving _everything_ every time, 
there is great power in only saving "good" or "finished" changes to a large project,
while leaving work-in-progress elsewhere unsaved. You probably won't need this level
of control until you get to the course project, but it's better to have it than not.

[^6]: Some of the issues identified by `lintr` may be _false positives_, but the 
false positive rate is quite low, especially for the sort of procedural code that
is the focus of this course. You should default to trying to appease `lintr`, but
feel free to use the course discussion board for any questions.
