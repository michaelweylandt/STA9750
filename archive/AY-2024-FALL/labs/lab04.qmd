# Single Table Operations

This week, we are going to practice "single-table" (one data frame) operations
using `dplyr`. In this scenario, we assume all the relevant data to a problem
has been collected into a single object ready for use. We also assume that the
data has been made "tidy" with clearly defined row and column structure. 

For this set of exercises, we will use the `flights` data from the `nycflights13`
package. Per the relevant help file, this data set contains on-time data
for all flights that departed the three major NYC airports (EWR, LGA, JFK) in
2013.[^1] As usual, we begin by installing and loading the necessary packages:

```{webr}
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
if(!require("nycflights13")) install.packages("nycflights13")
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

The `nycflights13` package provides us with the `flights` data set:

```{webr}
glimpse(flights)
```

We see here that this is a large data set, with `{r} NROW(flights)` rows and 
`{r} NCOL(flights)` columns. This actually isn't too big for `R` (only about 40 MB) but you might want to follow along with this analysis on your personal `R`, instead of in your browser if things start to feel sluggish.

In this [week's preassignment](../preassigns/pa04.html), you already were
introduced to the `select` and `filter` operators for column and row selection.
Let's now dig into them more and explore some more advanced operations. 

## `R`'s Missing Data Model - `NA`

Let's begin with a simple question: what is the _single most delayed flight_
in our data set: 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(arr_delay == max(arr_delay))
```

Hmmmm...That's odd. Certainly _something_ has to be the maximum arrival delay -
why did we get no rows back? 

Let's look at this expression more closely: firstly, what happens if we simply
fix a delay amount? 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(arr_delay == 60)
```

That's fine. So perhaps the problem was in computing `max(arr_delay)`. 

```{webr}
flights |> summarize(max(arr_delay))
```

That's weird - what is this `NA` object? 

`NA` is `R`'s representation of _missing_ data: this is not a `NaN` object
you have seen from other languages. `NaN` represents invalid arithmetic output
(Not-a-Number), *e.g*, 

```{webr}
0 / 0
```

`NA` is _statistical_ missingness. The data exists - and is well defined - but
we simply don't know it. Like we said above, there is _some_ most delayed flight,
but we don't know what it is. 

The `NA` construct is a bit odd when you start with it - but it's actually 
one of `R`'s great strengths. Missingness matters in data analysis and `R`
forces you to deal with it explicitly. The behavioral rules of `NA` are 
reasonably straightforward - `NA` is 'contagious'. Any calculation that takes
at least one `NA` input usually has `NA` output. (This is not dissimilar to
the "random in, random out" rule of functions of random variables) For example: 

```{webr}
3 + NA
```

```{webr}
NA > 0
```

```{webr}
NA / 4
```

```{webr}
0 * NA
```

That last result may be a bit surprising - isn't anything times zero just zero?

That's true in 'real' math, but not actually true for computer ("floating-point")
math: 

```{webr}
0 * Inf
```

Here, because `0 * NA` could be `0` or `NaN`, the answer is still unknown and
hence `NA`. 

There are some rare operations where `NA` can be "over-ruled" but they are 
not super common: 

```{webr}
any(c(NA, TRUE))
```

This follows because both: 

```{webr}
any(c(TRUE, TRUE))
any(c(FALSE, TRUE))
```

so the value of `NA` doesn't actually matter here. 

Also note that not all `NA` values are 'the same': 

```{webr}
NA == NA
```

Why is this the case? Well, suppose we rewrite this as: 

```{webr}
today_temp    <- NA
tomorrow_temp <- NA

today_temp == tomorrow_temp
```

Is today the same temperature as tomorrow? If we don't know either temperature,
we can't say!

Similarly, 

```{webr}
today_temp - tomorrow_temp
```

### `is.na` and `na.rm`

While it's certainly helpful that `R` handles `NA` values so intelligently
for us, it can also be a bit annoying. Eventually we want (non-`NA`) answers!

We generally deal with this in one of two ways: 

- filtering out `NA` values from our data set
- ignoring `NA` values in our calculations.

We've already done a bit of the latter option - ignoring `NA` values in our
calculations - so let's review it first. 

Most base `R` functions have an `na.rm` optional argument to remove NA values. 
Returning to our motivating example: 

```{webr}
flights |> summarize(max(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

or indeed

```{webr}
flights |> filter(arr_delay == max(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

That's a horrendous (21+ hour) delay! But is it actually the "maximum" delay? 
It depends... we'll come back to this example in a bit. 

Not all functions, however, provide a `na.rm` argument: in those cases, it's 
our responsibility to remove the `NA` values ourselves. 

We can do this using the `is.na` function: this takes in a vector of values
and finds the `NA`s: 

```{webr}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5)
is.na(x)
```

If we combine this with the `filter` operator, we now have an efficient way
of removing `NA` values: 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(!is.na(arr_delay))
```

From here, we can get back to our analysis of the most delayed flight: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |>
    filter(arr_delay == max(arr_delay)) |>
    glimpse()
```

Poor folks!

*Note that I'm using `glimpse` here to ensure all columns are printed.*

### `drop_na`

`dplyr` provides a `drop_na` function which removes _any_ row that has an `NA`
value in _any_ column. It's a bit of a blunt approach - do you really need
remove a row in computing `X` just because it has an `NA` value in column `Y`? -
but it can be useful for "quick and dirty" work. I recommend against using it
without a thorough manual examination of your data first however. 

### `NA` values in `filter`

Earlier we saw that `filter` plays funny with `NA` values. It's worth being
explicit here

```{webr}
tiny_example <- tribble(~letter, ~value, "a", 1, "b", NA)
print(tiny_example)
tiny_example |> filter(value > 0)
```

`filter` checks for `TRUE` conditions - not for "not `FALSE`". Because of this,
checks which result in `NA` lead to dropped rows. This means that most `NA` rows
are automatically discarded when you start filtering. 

This isn't a bad default - but it's one you should be aware of. For instance, 
in our motivating example:

We might use the following to compute the average arrival delay: 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> summarize(mean(arr_delay))
```

but this drops 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(is.na(arr_delay)) |> NROW()
```

flights for which we have no arrival delay information. Of these, 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(arr_time)) |> NROW()
```

we even have an arrival time but the delay itself is missing for some reason. 
Is it fair to exclude these flights or should we compute the delay ourselves? 
For flights that are missing arrival and departure times (*i.e.*, cancelled
flights), should we exclude them? Are they infinitely delayed? 24 hour delayed
(assuming passengers were rebooked to the same flight on the next day)? 

There's no clear right-or-wrong answer to questions like this. It's all context
dependent: if you are the DOT trying to ensure good customer experience, a
cancelled flight is _very_ delayed; if you are instead a Boeing engineer looking
to improve flight speeds, the cancelled flights simply aren't useful to you.

When faced with these challenges, data scientists often give the answer "defer
to subject matter experts (SMEs)". Unfortunately, we rarely have the resources
to have a qualified SME at hand to answer ever little data analytic question we
may have. 

I instead advocate for a strategy of _reproducible transparency_. Using tools
like `quarto`, we can show our code and document the choices made. Then, when
we share our results with an SME, 


## Boolean Operators and `filter`

`filter()` lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. To use `filter()`, pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. `filter()` will return every row that passes each logical test.

So for example, we can use `filter()` to select every flight in flights that departed on January 1st:

```{webr}
library(nycflights13) # Load the flights data
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

The `filter` function is similar to the `WHERE` clause in SQL.
As we will later see, it can also be used to implement the `HAVING` clause,
when applied in conjunction with `group_by`.

Like all dplyr functions, `filter()` returns a new data frame for you
to save or use. It doesn't overwrite the old data frame. If you want to save the
output of `filter()`, you'll need to use the assignment operator, `<-`.

Rerun the command in the code chunk below, but first arrange to save the output to an object named `jan1`.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

::: {.solution exercise="ex_1"}

```{webr}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

:::

Good job! You can now see the results by running the name `jan1` by itself. 
Or you can pass `jan1` to a function that takes data frames as input.

Did you notice that this code used the double equal operator, `==`? `==` is one of R's logical comparison operators. Comparison operators are key to making full
use of `filter()`, so let's take a closer look at them.

### Logical Comparisons

R provides a suite of comparison operators that you can use to compare values: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). Each creates a logical test. For example, is `pi` greater than three?

```{r}
pi > 3
```

When you place a logical test inside of `filter()`, filter applies the test to each row in the data frame and then returns the rows that pass, as a new data frame.

Our code above returned every row whose month value was equal to one _and_ 
whose day value was equal to one.

#### Watch out!

When you start out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to test for equality with `=` instead of `==`. When this happens you'll get an informative error:

```{webr, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

If you give `filter()` more than one logical test, `filter()` will combine the tests with an implied "and." In other words, `filter()` will return only the rows that return `TRUE` for every test. You can combine tests in other ways with Boolean operators...

#### &, |, and !

R uses Boolean operators to combine multiple logical comparisons into a single logical test. These include `&` (*and*), `|` (*or*), `!` (*not* or *negation*), and `xor()` (*exclusive or*).

Both `|` and `xor()` will return `TRUE` if one or the other logical comparison returns `TRUE`. `xor()` differs from `|` in that it will return `FALSE` if both logical comparisons return TRUE. The name _xor_ stands for _exclusive or_.

Study the diagram below to get a feel for how these operators work.

![In the figure above, `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each command selects.](../images/transform-logical.png)

#### Common mistakes

In `R`, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write
`filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all
flights that departed in November or December". Be sure to write out a
_complete_ test on each side of a Boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean 
operators in `R`:

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select 
   every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to 
   rewrite the code in the question above:

```{webr}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

2. Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering 
   De Morgan's laws: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and 
   `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find
   flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two
   hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

```{webr}
dml1 <- filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
dml2 <- filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
identical(dml1, dml2)
dml1
```

3. As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. 
   Don't use them with `filter()`! You'll learn when you 
   should use them later.

4. Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`,
   consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier
   to check your work.

```

## Grouped Operations

In this [week's preassignment](../preassigns/pa04.html), you also already saw
the basics of the `group_by` operator for performing analyses on subgroups. The
most common use of `group_by` is to modify `summarize` to perform group-wise
summarization. We'll next explore how it can be used to do group level filtering,
similar to an SQL `HAVING` clause. 

As before, let's start by asking what is the average arrival delay (after
removing `NA` values)? 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> summarize(mean(arr_delay))
```

Ok. But now suppose we want to know _which carrier_ had flights that were
later than average? We_could_ simply copy the value over into a new
line of code: 

```{webr}
flights |> filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> filter(arr_delay > 6.90)
```

To get carrier-wise statistics, we might try: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    filter(arr_delay > 6.90) |>
    group_by(carrier) |>
    summarize(n = n())
```

This works, but it requires us to keep the number 6.9 at hand, which is a bit
inconvenient.  

We next might be tempted to use a variable here to avoid hard-coding a specific
value: 

```{webr}
avg_delay <- flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    summarize(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |>
    pull(mean_delay)

flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    filter(arr_delay > avg_delay) |>
    group_by(carrier) |>
    summarize(n = n())
```

This is definitely better! If our data changes, we don't have to worry about
the number 6.9 being 'out of date'. But it's still maybe a bit clunky: we filter
our data twice for `NA` values and have to repeat ourselves. 

Let's try something else: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    mutate(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay))
```

This creates a new column called mean delay. On its own, it's
not very interesting: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    mutate(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |>
    select(mean_delay, arr_delay, carrier, everything())
```

*Note the trick of using `everything()` inside a select statement to reorder columns.*

The `mean_delay` column simply repeats the number 6.9 over and over. (Recall
`R`'s recycling rules- we needed a long vector here, so the output of `mean` 
was repeated enough to fill the whole table.) But now we can work with this: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    mutate(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |>
    select(mean_delay, arr_delay, carrier, everything()) |>
    filter(arr_delay > mean_delay)
```

and, if we want, we can get the carrier specific statistics: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    mutate(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |>
    select(mean_delay, arr_delay, carrier, everything()) |>
    filter(arr_delay > mean_delay) |>
    group_by(carrier) |>
    summarize(n = n())
```

Pretty nice! And when it matters - for very large data stored on a database - a
little faster to boot!

Before going deeper down this path, what happens if we move the `group_by`
earlier in our pipeline? 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    group_by(carrier) |>
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    mutate(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |>
    select(mean_delay, arr_delay, carrier, everything()) |>
    filter(arr_delay > mean_delay) |>
    summarize(n = n())
```

Definitely different! But why? 

To see the difference, let's compare the `mean_delay` column: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    group_by(carrier) |>
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    mutate(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |>
    select(mean_delay, arr_delay, carrier, everything())
```

We now see here that the `mean_delay` is computed "group-wise", so we're not
getting flights that are delayed compared _to an average flight_; we are instead
counting flights that are delayed compared _to an average flight on that airline_. Put another way, we're holding American Airlines (AA) and Delta (DL)
flights to a higher standard than Jet Blue (B6) or ExpressJet (EV). 

As always - the question you should ask yourself is not "is this the right thing" but "when is this the right thing?". It's simply a different question!

Recall that `group_by` followed by a `summarize` removes one "layer" of grouping.
If we use this `group_by` + `mutate` + `filter` construction, the result is still
grouped, which can lead to weird bugs. To address this, it is sometimes easier
to use the `.by` argument to `mutate` and `filter` which will modify the grouping
_for that command only_. 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |> 
    mutate(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay), 
           .by=carrier) |>
    select(mean_delay, arr_delay, carrier, everything())
```

It's a matter of taste. 

### `HAVING` clause

Recall that a SQL `HAVING` clause applies group-level filtering based on
some summary statistics: this is easy enough in `dplyr`. 

For example, suppose we want the average flight delays _of large airlines_, which
we can define as those with more than 10,000 departures in our data set. 

We can compute this in two ways: directly, computing the number of flights and
average delay for each airline. 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |>
    group_by(carrier) |>
    summarize(n = n(), 
              mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |>
    filter(n > 10000)
```

This totally works, but now we've lost all the other flight-level information. 
An alternate approach is to compute counts group-wise and filter before averaging:

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |>
    group_by(carrier) |>
    mutate(n = n()) |>
    filter(n > 10000) |>
    summarize(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) 
```

This has the advantage of being readily adaptable to other non-summarizing
questions: for instance, of the _delayed_ flights of the major carrier, how
many were going to Houston?

```{webr}
flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) |>
    group_by(carrier) |>
    mutate(n = n()) |>
    filter(n > 10000,
           arr_delay > 0, # Could also write as separate filter()s
           dest %in% c("HOU", "IAH")) |>
    summarize(n = n())
```

Here, we re-used the `n` column and so the old value of `n` was quietly
replaced. This is probably ok with a simple variable name like `n` (which wasn't
all that interesting) but for "raw" data columns, you probably should avoid this.

In class, we'll do more exercises based on group-specific filtering, both
filtering on groups and filtering within groups. See if you can answer: 

1. What carrier has the lowest rate of delayed flights? 
2. What carrier has the highest chance of early arrivals?
3. What carrier is most likely to "make up time in flight" after a delayed departure? 
4. Which origin airport has the highest rate of delays? 
5. Which month has the most flights? 
6. What is the furthest flight in this data? 
7. What is the shortest flight in this data? 
8. Are longer flights more likely to be delayed than short ones?

The readings in this tutorial follow [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), section 5.2. The exercises for `filter`
were adapted from [the official documentation](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-data-filter/) of the
`learnr` package.

[^1]: The 2013 NYC version of this data has become a semi-standard teaching
example, but the  US [Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0) releases new versions of this data constantly. If you are
interested in performing this type of analysis for a different set of airports
or a different time period, check out the [`anyflights` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages//anyflights/index.html). It's
very easy - but a bit slow - to get flight data from almost any US airport
this way. If you want to develop your data cleaning skills, it's a great
exercise to parse the BTS website directly and compare your output with the
`anyflights` package.
