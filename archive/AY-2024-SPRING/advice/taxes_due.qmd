## Life Tip of the Week {.smaller}

It's time to pay your taxes ðŸ˜¢

. . . 

- Preparing is not the same as *filing* 
  - Preparing is doing the calculations
  - Filing is submitting to IRS
- Employers and financial institutions already sent your
  documents (W2, 1099, *etc.*)
- You can still make certain 2024 tax moves and get the tax
  benefit(IRA, HSA, *etc.*)
- [Extensions available](https://www.irs.gov/filing/get-an-extension-to-file-your-tax-return) but possibility of penalties!
  - You have to request by April 15 and will owe more if no refund

. . .

If your income is less than ~$98K single or ~$113K married, the
[IRS FreeFile](https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-free-file-do-your-taxes-for-free) program means you can use TaxAct, *etc.* for free.[^free]

[^free]: These companies don't advertise this widely, but they have
a long-standing relationship with the IRS that requires this. Use 
the links on [irs.gov](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers/) 
to get routed to the right place
