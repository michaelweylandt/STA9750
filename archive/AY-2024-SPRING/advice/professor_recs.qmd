## Life Tip of the Week

### Recommendations from Professors

In the near future, you may want recommendations from your professors. Some advice on getting good recommendations: 

1. Understand professional vs academic recommendations
2. Seek out  _strong_ recommendations
3. Confidential recommendations _highly preferrable_

## Professional vs Academic Recommendations

- *Professional*: For a job. Typically a brief survey or quick reference check.

- *Academic*: For awards, fellowships, research positions, graduate admissions. A *personalized letter* from me.

I can usually do professional recommendations quickly (4-5 business days).
Academic recommendations require a minimum of two weeks.

## _Strong_ Recommendations

A _strong_ recommendation is one that supplements what is already in your application. 

- Say things that aren't on your transcript
- Attest to character and quality of work

The better I know you, the stronger a letter I can write. 

You can ask if a professor can write you a _strong_
recommendation. If they say they can write, but it may not be strong, consider asking elsewhere. 

## _Strong_ Recommendations {.smaller}

Ugly: 

> Student N took my class and received an A. 

Bad: 

> Student N took my XYZ class and received an A. My XYZ class covers ABC at an advanced level and provides N a strong foundation for your program.

Good: 

> I first met student N in my XYZ class. She was an active participant in class, regularly attended my office hours, and regularly asked for additional advanced material. She had a remarkable final project in which she ABC. It is clear that her drive and passion for XYZ make her an excellent candidate for your fellowship. 


## _Confidentiality_ 

Under some parts of US law, you have the right to see what
letters for you I write unless you specifically waive that
right. 

**Waive the right**

. . . 

Readers will assume you have read a non-confidential letter
and discount whatever I say. 

## My Policy {.smaller}

I will write a letter for any student who has passed one 
of my classes (C or higher) or is on track to do so. 

No guarantee it is _strong_ unless you ask. I understand that
sometimes you are just trying to make sure you have enough.

Give me at least 3 weeks, ideally more. A rushed letter is a
short and generic letter. 

Send me: 
 
- Description of who I'm writing to
- Your CV / Resume
- Your latest transcript
- Presentations/project materials from my class

Once I have a letter written, it's easier for me to update and re-use.

_Help me help you._
