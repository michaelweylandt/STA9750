## Life Tip of the Week {.smaller}

It's time to start preparing your taxes. (I know, I know ...)

. . . 

- Preparing is not the same as *filing* 
  - Preparing is doing the calculations
  - Filing is submitting to IRS
- Employers and financial institutions should be sending you
  documents (W2, 1099, *etc.*)
  - Easier to use them now so you don't lose them
- Benefits of starting early: 
  - If you get a refund, great!
  - If you owe money, avoid nasty surprise. 
- You can still make certain 2024 tax moves and get the tax
  benefit(IRA, HSA, *etc.*)

. . .

If your income is less than ~$98K single or ~$113K married, the
[IRS FreeFile](https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-free-file-do-your-taxes-for-free) program means you can use TaxAct, *etc.* for free.[^free]

[^free]: These companies don't advertise this widely, but they have
a long-standing relationship with the IRS that requires this. Use
