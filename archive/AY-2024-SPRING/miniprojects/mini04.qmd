::: {.callout-caution title="Assignment Modification 2025-04-24"}

Recognizing the busy end of the semester, I am going to rein in the scope of
this mini-project. In particular, 

> **You are no longer required to complete Task 6 or the "in character" write-up.**

Reports that complete all elements up to Task 5 (re-creation of county shift map)
will be eligible for full credit. For Task 4 (preliminary EDA), you may simply
state your findings without any particular writing style.

Up to 10 points of *Extra Credit* may be assigned for completion of Task 6, as follows:

- up to 2 points for each computationally-intensive statistical test (4 total)
- up to 2 points for each "talking point" (6 total)

## Introduction

Welcome to Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}! Following the 2024 US Presidential
election, the New York Times published a [highly influential
map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html)
depicting a national political shift to the right. This map, and associated 
commentary, portended a national "vibe shift", which has already (arguably) been
reflected throughout corporate, educational, and government sectors. In this
mini-project, you will explore this national political shift, determining 
the extent (if any) it may have been over- or under-exaggerated and developing 
appropriate visualizations. 

For this mini-project, you will pay the roll of a partisan "Talking Head" aligned
with one of the two major US political parties. You will find facts supporting
your party's narrative and prepare related visualizations. For this project, you
are encouraged (but not required) to adopt the opposite side of your own
political beliefs.[^side] For example, if you adopt a Republican perspective,
you may choose to highlight the fact that 89% of counties nationwide voted more
Republican than in 2020; if you adopt a Democratic perspective, you may retort
that "land doesn't vote" and that a population weighted measure of national
shift shows a far smaller effect. 

[^side]: It is well-documented that political partisans subject their opponents
to far more rigorous critique than their co-partisans. By adopting a point-of-view
opposite your own, you will not only (hopefully) become more sympathetic to 
and informed about alternative political views, but you will also perform a more
rigorous analysis. Still, since I do not know and do not want to know your true
political views, this is only a suggestion and cannot be enforced. 
 
Note that, compared to previous mini-projects, the scope of this project
is relatively smaller: in light of this, and the more advanced skills you have
spent the past 3 months developing, this mini-project should be the least
difficult of the course. At this point in the course, you should be spending the majority of your out-of-class hours on your [Course Project](../project.html). 

This mini-project completes our whirlwind tour of several different
forms of data-driven writing: 

- White-Papers and Policy Briefs ([MP#01](./mini01.html))
- Quantifying Successful Public Policy Endeavors ([MP#02](./mini02.html))
- Using Data to Supplement the Creative Process ("assistive intelligence",
  [MP#03](./mini03.html))
- Using Data to Support a Pre-Ordained Conclusion (this mini-project)

There are, of course, many other ways that data can be used to generate and
communicate insights, but hopefully this "hit parade" has exposed you
to many of the ways that you can use data to evaluate complex qualitative
and quantitative claims outside of a binary classroom "correct/incorrect"
structure. The tools of quantitative analysis and communication you have
developed in this course can be used in essentially infinite contexts--
we have only scratched the surface--and I'm excited to see what you do
in the remainder of this course, in your remaining time at Baruch, and
in your future careers. 

### Student Responsbilities

Recall our basic analytic workflow and table of student responsibilities:

-   Data Ingest and Cleaning: Given a single data source, read it into `R` and transform it to a reasonably useful standardized format.
-   Data Combination and Alignment: Combine multiple data sources to enable insights not possible from a single source.
-   Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Take a data table and compute informative summary statistics from both the entire population and relevant subgroups
-   Data Visualization: Generate insightful data visualizations to spur insights not attainable from point statistics
-   Inferential Statistical Analysis and Modeling: Develop relevant predictive models and statistical analyses to generate insights about the *underlying population* and not simply the data at hand.

: Mini-Project Grading Rubric

Note that this rubric is designed with copious opportunities for extra credit 
if students go *above and beyond* the instructor-provided scaffolding. Students
pursuing careers in data analytics are strongly encouraged to go beyond the
strict ambit of the mini-projects to i) further refine their skills; ii) learn
additional techniques that can be used in the final course project; and iii)
develop a more impressive professional portfolio.

Because students are encouraged to use {{< var course.short >}} mini-projects as
the basis for a professional portfolio, the basic skeleton of each project will
be released under a fairly permissive usage license. Take advantage of it!

### Submission Instructions

After completing the analysis, write up your findings, *showing all of 
your code*, using a dynamic `quarto` document and post it to your course 
repository. The `qmd` file should be named `{r} I(mp_file$qmd)` so the rendered 
document can be found at `{r} I(mp_file$html_long)` in the student's repository 
and served at the URL:[^sub]

> `https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html`

Once you confirm this website works (substituting `<GITHUB_ID>` for the actual 
GitHub username provided to the professor in [MP#00](./mini00.html) of course), 
open a new issue at

> `https://github.com/michaelweylandt/{{< var course.repo >}}/issues/new` .

Title the issue `{{< var course.short >}} <GITHUB_ID> MiniProject #{{< meta mp_num >}}` and 
fill in the following text for the issue:

::: {#submission-text}

```
Hi @michaelweylandt!

I've uploaded my work for MiniProject #**{{< meta mp_num >}}** - check it out!

https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html
```

:::


Once the submission deadline passes, the instructor will tag classmates for 
peer feedback in this issue thread.

*Additionally*, a PDF export of this report should be submitted on Brightspace. 
To create a PDF from the uploaded report, simply use your browser's 'Print to PDF'
functionality.

**NB**: The analysis outline below specifies key *tasks* you need to perform
within your write up. Your peer evaluators will check that you complete these. 
You are encouraged to do extra analysis, but the bolded **Tasks** are *mandatory*.

**NB**: Your final submission should look like a *report*, not simply a list of
facts answering questions. Add introductions, conclusions, and your own
commentary. You should be practicing both raw *coding* skills and written
*communication* in all mini-projects. There is little value in data points stated
without context or motivation.

[^sub]: Throughout this section, replace `<GITHUB_ID>` with your GitHub ID from
[Mini-Project #00](./mini00.html), making sure to remove the angle brackets. Note
that the automated course infrastructure will be looking for precise formatting,
so follow these instructions closely. 

## Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}: {{< meta mp_title >}}

For this project, we are going to need to collect election result data. As
of the time I'm writing this project, it's surprisingly hard to find free, clean
county-level election data, so we are going to use our new web-scraping skills
to extract this data from Wikipedia. 

::: {.callout-danger title="Do Not Use Alternative Data Sources or `R` Packages"}

High-quality `R` packages exist to help work with some of the data providers
used in this mini-project. Despite this, you **may not** use these packages: the
learning goal of this mini-project is to practice scraping and importing data
from various web based services. Using `R` packages instead of scraping the data
"by hand" will not provide this practice. By the same token, do not use 
alternative data sources. (That said, if you find better county level records of
the 2024 election, please let me know. I found this surprisingly difficult data
to locate.)

:::

### County Shapes: US Census Bureau

Begin by downloading a **shapefile** containing US county (and equivalent) 
boundaries from the [US Census
Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2023/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). Note that this file is available in three resolutions. I recommend 
the finest resolution you can to produce the most accurate graphics, but if
your compute is struggling with high levels of detail, you should consider
falling back to the coarser resolutions. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 1: US County Shapefiles"}

Write code to download an appropriate US County shapefile from the Census Bureau
website. To be responsible, your download code should: 

1) Only download the file if it is not already present
2) Create a directory titled `data/mp04` if one is not already present
3) Save the file in `data/mp04` and, if necessary, decompress it. 
4) Use built-in `R` functions like `download.file`

See previous mini-projects for guidance.

:::

### 2024 County-Level Election Results

We will next obtain *county-level* election results for each of the 50 US states. 
While most states make this data available via the Secretary of State or an 
Election Board, these sites are non-uniform and tricky to use in an automated
fashion. Instead, we will take our results from Wikipedia. For each state, 
there is a Wikipedia page describing the 2024 US Presidential Election results
in that state; *e.g.*, [New
York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_New_York). 

Each of these pages has a table of county-level results which we need to extract. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 2: Acquire 2024 US Presidential Election Results"}

Using `httr2` and `rvest` download county-level election results from Wikipedia
for each of the 50 US States. 

This is a moderately advanced web-scraping exercise, so I recommend you approach
it by writing a function which does the following. 

- Take a US state name as input
- Construct an appropriate request using `httr2::request` and
  `req_url_path()`[^spaces]
- Performs the request, saving the result locally to avoid unnecessary repeated
  downloads
- Extracts all tables into a list object
- Selects only the table with a column titled `County`
- Appropriately cleans and parses the table
- Adds a column with the state name

Note that you will have to deal with various additional minor irregularities
not described above. For instance, at least one US State uses a term other than
"county" to describe the relevant unit of government.

[^spaces]: Note that Wikipedia allows spaces in URLs here, so you can use
`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024 United States presidential election in New York`
and it will be automatically corrected to 
`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_New_York`. 
:::

The code used to extract EIA State Energy Profiles in an early mini-project may
be somewhat helpful here. 

### 2020 County-Level Election Results

Next, modify your code to extract results for the 2020 election. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 3: Acquire 2020 US Presidential Election Results"}

Modify your code from Task 2 to acquire 2020 US Presidential Election Results.

:::

### Combine Data and Perform Initial Analyses

At this point, we have all of the data needed to complete this mini-project 
(though you are, as always, welcome to download additional data you find helpful.)
Combine the three data files (county shapes, 2020 results, 2024 results) and
use them to answer the following questions. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 4: Initial Analysis Questions"}

Answer the following questions using the combined data sources. As always, as
you do this initial analysis, use it as an opportunity to verify that your data
import and cleaning was accurate. 

1. Which county or counties cast the most votes for Trump (in absolute terms) 
   in 2024? 
2. Which county or counties cast the most votes for Biden (as a fraction of
   total votes cast) in 2020? 
3. Which county or counties had the largest shift towards Trump (in absolute 
   terms) in 2024? 
4. Which state had the largest shift towards Harris (or smallest shift towards 
   Trump) in 2024? (Note that the total votes for a state can be obtained by
   summing all counties in that state.)
5. What is the largest county, by area, in this data set? 
6. Which county has the highest voter density (voters per unit of area) in 2020?
7. Which county had the largest increase in voter turnout in 2024? 

:::

### Reproduce NYT Figure

Having confirmed our data is mainly reliable, we are now ready to reproduce
the [NYT 
Figure](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html)
that initially motivated this project. 

To do so, you need to: 

1) Compute the shift (as a percentage of votes cast) rightwards for each county. 
2) Modify the geometry file to put Hawaii and Alaska in a more reasonable position
   for visualization. This [StackOverflow
   Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78867955) has useful suggestions. 
3) Draw a map of the US with the modified geometry. [^lines]
4) Compute the center point ("centroid") of each county. 
5) Add an arrow for each county, located at its centroid. The length of the 
   arrow should be proportional to the shift and the direction should indicate
   whether that shift was rightward or leftward. 

You may need to play around with the parameters defining each arrow to create 
an attractive plot. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 5: Reproduce NYT Figure"}

Reproduce the NYT County Shift figure using the Census shapefiles and
Wikipedia-extracted election results.

:::

[^lines]: A map with lines for each county may be a bit too dense to read. You
might find it more visually appealing to take the
"[union](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_combine.html)" of
counties to get  states for creating the base map layer. 

### Additional Data Analysis

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 6: Additional Analysis and Figure Creation"}

Further analyze this data and come up with three partisan "talking points" 
(and associated figures) to support "your side".

Your analysis should include at least two *computationally-intensive*
statistical tests, *e.g.*, "did the median county shift by more than 5%?". 
You may implement these directly or with help of the [`infer`
package](https://infer.netlify.app/).

:::

## Deliverable: Partisan Talking Points

Taking the position of a "partisan hack", analyze the 2024 election and argue
that Trump's victory was either a nationwide seismic shift portending a new era
in American politics (if you adopt a Republican persona) or a narrow win made
to look more meaningful than it actually was by accidents of geometry and
political organization (if you adopt a Democratic persona). 

You should write in the style of an "op-ed" or a television commercial script 
(your choice) attempting to influence national post-election discourse in support
of your chosen side. 

Have some fun with this! You can be as shameless and over-the-top as you want. 
After all, it was a politician who (anecdotally) gave us the phrase: 

> ["Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies%2C_damned_lies%2C_and_statistics)

and a (rather controversial) journalist who gave us

> [*How to Lie with Statistics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics)

## Extra Credit Opportunities

There are no structured opportunities for extra credit on this mini-project
beyond those stated in the rubric. As always, evaluators should assign
appropriate extra credit (no more than 5 points total) for particularly creative
insights, use of additional data sources, attractive figures, *etc.*
