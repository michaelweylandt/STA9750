## Introduction

Welcome to Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}. In this project, you will take on
the role of Executive Director of the Green Transit Alliance for Investigation
of Variance (GTA IV). GTA IV will be giving a series of awards for the
"greenest" public transit agencies. Your final submission for this mini-project
should take the form of a press release, announcing the winners of the various
GTA IV awards and giving the key statistics that lead to their selection.

For this project, you will use "multi-table" operations such as joins and pivots,
to combine data from different sources to generate novel insights not attainable
from any individual table. Our analysis will bring in data from two federal
sources, the [National Transit Database](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd) and
the [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/). 
 
### Student Responsbilities

Recall our basic analytic workflow and table of student responsibilities:

-   Data Ingest and Cleaning: Given a single data source, read it into `R` and transform it to a reasonably useful standardized format.
-   Data Combination and Alignment: Combine multiple data sources to enable insights not possible from a single source.
-   Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Take a data table and compute informative summary statistics from both the entire population and relevant subgroups
-   Data Visualization: Generate insightful data visualizations to spur insights not attainable from point statistics
-   Inferential Statistical Analysis and Modeling: Develop relevant predictive models and statistical analyses to generate insights about the *underlying population* and not simply the data at hand.

: Students' Responsibilities in Mini-Project Analyses {.hover}

In this mini-project, you are mainly responsible for data alignment and basic statistical analyses. While not the main focus of this mini-project, you are also expected to provide basic data visualizations to support your findings; the grading rubric, below, emphasizes the `dplyr` tools used in this project, but reports without any visualization will be penalized severely. Note that data visualization will play a larger role in Mini-Project #03.

As before, I will provide code to automatically download and read in the data used for this project. Also note that, as compared with Mini-Project #01, I am providing significantly less 'scaffolding': students are more responsible for directing their own analyses.

### Rubric

{{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects are evaluated using *peer grading* with
*meta-review* by the course GTAs. Specifically, variants of the following rubric
will be used for the mini-projects:

: Mini-Project Grading Rubric

Note that this rubric is designed with copious opportunities for extra credit if students go *above and beyond* the instructor-provided scaffolding. Students pursuing careers in data analytics are strongly encouraged to go beyond the strict ambit of the mini-projects to i) further refine their skills; ii) learn additional techniques that can be used in the final course project; and iii) develop a more impressive professional portfolio.

Because students are encouraged to use {{< var course.short >}} mini-projects as
the basis for a professional portfolio, the basic skeleton of each project will be
released under a fairly permissive usage license. Take advantage of it!

### Submission Instructions

After completing the analysis, write up your findings, *showing all of your
code*, using a dynamic `quarto` document and post it to your course repository.
The `qmd` file should be named `{r} I(mp_file$qmd)` so the rendered document can
be found at `{r} I(mp_file$html_long)` in the student's repository and served at
the URL:[^sub]

> `https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html`

Once you confirm this website works (substituting `<GITHUB_ID>` for the actual
GitHub username provided to the professor in [MP#00](./mini00.html) of course),
open a new issue at

> `https://github.com/michaelweylandt/{{< var course.repo >}}/issues/new` .

Title the issue `{{< var course.short >}} <GITHUB_ID> MiniProject #{{< meta mp_num >}}` 
and fill in the following text for the issue:

::: {#submission-text}

```         
Hi @michaelweylandt!

I've uploaded my work for MiniProject #**{{< meta mp_num >}}** - check it out!

https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html
```

:::



Once the submission deadline passes, the instructor will tag classmates for peer feedback in this issue thread.

*Additionally*, a PDF export of this report should be submitted on Brightspace. To create a PDF from the uploaded report, simply use your browser's 'Print to PDF' functionality.

**NB**: The analysis outline below specifies key *tasks* you need to perform within your write up. Your peer evaluators will check that you complete these. You are encouraged to do extra analysis, but the bolded **Tasks** are *mandatory*.

**NB**: Your final submission should look like a *report*, not simply a list of facts answering questions. Add introductions, conclusions, and your own commentary. You should be practicing both raw *coding* skills and written *communication* in all mini-projects. There is little value in data points stated without context or motivation.

that the automated course infrastructure will be looking for precise formatting,
so follow these instructions closely. 

## Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}: {{< meta mp_title >}}

Among the commonly cited benefits of robust public transit is a reduction in 
environmental impact. In this mini-project, we will explore US Public Transit
systems to assess their environmental efficiency. Our analysis will use a 
variety of data sources to i) determine how many riders are served by different
transit systems; ii) determine how far each public transit system transports
an average rider; and iii) investigate the effective emissions associated with
each form of transit. 

### Data Acquisition

We begin by downloading and importing relevant data sets. For this mini-project,
we will download the following details: 

- EIA [State Electricity Profiles](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/), 
  which we will use to estimate the environmental impact of the electricity
  used to run certain transit systems. 
  
  

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 1: Data Import"}

Incorporate the instructor provided code below into your report. As you
do so, make sure to look for possible "keys" on which you will be able to join
datasets together. 

:::

#### State Electricity Profiles

For purposes of this analysis, we will assume that all electricity generation
in a state is fungible. That is, we will assign the average generation emissions
to all electric transit in a state, even if the transit authority officially
has a "green supply" agreement in place. 

The following code will parse the EIA SEP summary pages and create a "tidy"
table for your use: 

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
ensure_package <- function(pkg){
    pkg <- as.character(substitute(pkg))
    options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
    if(!require(pkg, character.only=TRUE)) install.packages(pkg)
    stopifnot(require(pkg, character.only=TRUE))
}

ensure_package(dplyr)
ensure_package(stringr)
ensure_package(tidyr)
ensure_package(httr2)
ensure_package(rvest)

ensure_package(purrr)
ensure_package(DT)

get_eia_sep <- function(state, abbr){
    state_formatted <- str_to_lower(state) |> str_replace_all("\\s", "")
    
    dir_name <- file.path("data", "mp02")
    file_name <- file.path(dir_name, state_formatted)
    
    dir.create(dir_name, showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
    
    if(!file.exists(file_name)){
        BASE_URL <- "https://www.eia.gov"
        REQUEST <- request(BASE_URL) |> 
            req_url_path("electricity", "state", state_formatted)
    
        RESPONSE <- req_perform(REQUEST)
    
        resp_check_status(RESPONSE)
        
        writeLines(resp_body_string(RESPONSE), file_name)
    }
    
    TABLE <- read_html(file_name) |> 
        html_element("table") |> 
        html_table() |>
        mutate(Item = str_to_lower(Item))
    
    if("U.S. rank" %in% colnames(TABLE)){
        TABLE <- TABLE |> rename(Rank = `U.S. rank`)
    }
    
    CO2_MWh <- TABLE |> 
        filter(Item == "carbon dioxide (lbs/mwh)") |>
        pull(Value) |> 
        str_replace_all(",", "") |>
        as.numeric()
    
    PRIMARY <- TABLE |> 
        filter(Item == "primary energy source") |> 
        pull(Rank)
    
    RATE <- TABLE |>
        filter(Item == "average retail price (cents/kwh)") |>
        pull(Value) |>
        as.numeric()
    
    GENERATION_MWh <- TABLE |>
        filter(Item == "net generation (megawatthours)") |>
        pull(Value) |>
        str_replace_all(",", "") |>
        as.numeric()
    
    data.frame(CO2_MWh               = CO2_MWh, 
               primary_source        = PRIMARY,
               electricity_price_MWh = RATE * 10, # / 100 cents to dollars &
               # * 1000 kWh to MWH 
               generation_MWh        = GENERATION_MWh, 
               state                 = state, 
               abbreviation          = abbr
    )
}

EIA_SEP_REPORT <- map2(state.name, state.abb, get_eia_sep) |> list_rbind()
```  

This produces the following table: 

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
ensure_package(scales)
ensure_package(DT)

EIA_SEP_REPORT |> 
    select(-abbreviation) |>
    arrange(desc(CO2_MWh)) |>
    mutate(CO2_MWh = number(CO2_MWh, big.mark=","), 
           electricity_price_MWh = dollar(electricity_price_MWh), 
           generation_MWh = number(generation_MWh, big.mark=",")) |>
    rename(`Pounds of CO2 Emitted per MWh of Electricity Produced`=CO2_MWh, 
           `Primary Source of Electricity Generation`=primary_source, 
           `Average Retail Price for 1000 kWh`=electricity_price_MWh, 
           `Total Generation Capacity (MWh)`= generation_MWh, 
           State=state) |>
    datatable()
```

&nbsp;

Here, we have collected the effective emissions per MWh[^mwh] as well as price
and total state-wide generation capacity. We will use this data to compare the
emissions of different transit modalities. We next turn to the National Transit
Database to get information on various public transit authorities. Before we
do so, however, let's explore the SEP data a bit first. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 2: Initial Analysis of SEP Data"}

Answer the following questions using the `EIA_SEP_REPORT` data: 

1. Which state has the most expensive retail electricity? 
2. Which state has the 'dirtiest' electricity mix? 
3. On average, how many pounds of CO2 are emitted per MWh of electricity
   produced in the US? (Note that you will need to use a suitably _weighted_
   average here.) 
4. What is the rarest primary energy source in the US? What is the associated
   cost of electricity and where is it used? 
5. My home state, Texas, has a reputation as being the home of "dirty fossil
   fuels" while NY has a reputation as a leader in clean energy. How many times
   cleaner is NY's energy mix than that of Texas?

#### 2023 Annual Database Energy Consumption

We first download the [2023 Annual Database Energy
Consumption](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2023-annual-database-energy-consumption)
report. This report is shared as a Excel spreadsheet (`.xlsx` filetype), so we
use the `readxl` package to import it to `R`. 

```{r}
#| warning: false
ensure_package(readxl)
# Create 'data/mp02' directory if not already present
DATA_DIR <- file.path("data", "mp02")
dir.create(DATA_DIR, showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)

NTD_ENERGY_FILE <- file.path(DATA_DIR, "2023_ntd_energy.xlsx")

if(!file.exists(NTD_ENERGY_FILE)){
    DS <- download.file("https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-10/2023%20Energy%20Consumption.xlsx", 
                  destfile=NTD_ENERGY_FILE, 
                  method="curl")
    
    if(DS | (file.info(NTD_ENERGY_FILE)$size == 0)){
        cat("I was unable to download the NTD Energy File. Please try again.\n")
        stop("Download failed")
    }
}

NTD_ENERGY_RAW <- read_xlsx(NTD_ENERGY_FILE)
```

::: {.callout-warning title="Selection of Download Methods"}

`R` provides several different internal tools to download data files from
the internet. These can be accessed more-or-less seamlessly by changing
the `method` argument of the `download.file` function. 

Depending on your operating system, different methods may work better than
others. Above, I used the `"curl"` method as that seemed to be the most robust
on my computer. If this doesn't work, for you, I would recommend trying the
following: 

- `method = "internal"`
- `method = "wget"`
- `method = "libcurl"`
- `method = "wininet"`

If none of these work, download the file by hand and save it as
`data/mp02/2023_ntd_energy.xlsx`. It is worth making sure that you are able
to download data files through `R` as this will be important in your course
project (and in life generally).

Next, we do some basic clean-up:

```{r}
#| warning: false
ensure_package(tidyr)
to_numeric_fill_0 <- function(x){
    x <- if_else(x == "-", NA, x)
    replace_na(as.numeric(x), 0)
}

NTD_ENERGY <- NTD_ENERGY_RAW |> 
    select(-c(`Reporter Type`, 
              `Reporting Module`, 
              `Other Fuel`, 
              `Other Fuel Description`)) |>
    mutate(across(-c(`Agency Name`, 
                     `Mode`,
                     `TOS`), 
                  to_numeric_fill_0)) |>
    group_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`, `Agency Name`) |>
    summarize(across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              .groups = "keep") |>
    mutate(ENERGY = sum(c_across(c(where(is.numeric))))) |>
    filter(ENERGY > 0) |>
    select(-ENERGY) |>
    ungroup()
```

The resulting table is almost ready for us to work with: 

```{r}
# Display 10 random rows
slice_sample(NTD_ENERGY , n=10)
```

Here, the first 3 columns (`NTD ID`, `Mode`, and `Agency Name`) identify the
operating agency and the relevant mode of transportation while the remaining
columns denote how much of each type of fuel that agency used during 2023. 
The non-electric sources are all quoted in gallons, while `Electric Battery`
and `Electric Propulsion` are quoted in kWh used. 
    
The `Mode` column is important: it is used to distinguish multiple transport
types operated the same agency, *e.g.* MTA subways and buses in NYC. The
two letter codes used by the NTD, however, are not immediately interpretable. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 3: Recoding the `Mode` column"}

First, find the unique `Mode` codes in our data using the `distinct` function. Next, examine the NTD website and find the interpretations of these codes. Complete the following snippet to recode the `Mode` column.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
## This code needs to be modified
NTD_ENERGY <- NTD_ENERGY |>
    mutate(Mode=case_when(
        Mode == "HR" ~ "Heavy Rail", 
        ...
        ...
        TRUE ~ "Unknown"))
```

#### 2023 Annual Database Service by Agency

Next, we download the [2023 Service by
Agency](https://data.transportation.gov/resource/6y83-7vuw.csv) report, from
which we will extract characteristics of typical passenger trips on each 
transit service. 

```{r}
#| message: false
NTD_SERVICE_FILE <- file.path(DATA_DIR, "2023_service.csv")
if(!file.exists(NTD_SERVICE_FILE)){
    DS <- download.file("https://data.transportation.gov/resource/6y83-7vuw.csv", 
                  destfile=NTD_SERVICE_FILE, 
                  method="curl")
    
    if(DS | (file.info(NTD_SERVICE_FILE)$size == 0)){
        cat("I was unable to download the NTD Service File. Please try again.\n")
        stop("Download failed")
    }
}

NTD_SERVICE_RAW <- read_csv(NTD_SERVICE_FILE)
```

As before, we need to clean up the data a bit before we can use it: 

```{r}
NTD_SERVICE <- NTD_SERVICE_RAW |>
    mutate(`NTD ID` = as.numeric(`_5_digit_ntd_id`)) |> 
    rename(Agency = agency, 
           City   = max_city, 
           State  = max_state,
           UPT    = sum_unlinked_passenger_trips_upt, 
           MILES  = sum_passenger_miles) |>
    select(matches("^[A-Z]", ignore.case=FALSE)) |>
    filter(MILES > 0)
```

Here `UPT` is the number of total _Unlinked Passenger Trips_ during 2023; that
is, the number of distinct (non-transfer) trips taken. *E.g.*, if you transfer
from the `7` to the `6` to get to Baruch. You ride two segments, but only take
1 UPT to get to Baruch (2 total UPT if you go home the same way). 

Let's explore this data a bit to get familiar with it. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 4: Explore NTD Service Data"}

Answer the following questions using the `NTD_SERVICE` data. 

1. Which transit service has the most UPT annually? 
2. What is the average trip length of a trip on MTA NYC? 
3. Which transit service in NYC has the _longest_ average trip length? 

   (NB: You need to be careful with the `City` column here. Certain MTA services
   are officially located in "New York City" while others are located in
   Brooklyn.)
4. Which state has the _fewest_ total miles travelled by public transit?
5. Are all states represented in this data? If no, which ones are missing?
   The `state.name` and `state.abb` objects we used above may be useful here. 

:::

We're now ready to start putting these datasets together and using them to 
identify America's greenest transit agencies. 

### Analysis

#### Calculate Total Emissions

Compute the total emissions associated with each Agency + Mode pair. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 5: Calculate Emissions"}

You will need to join the three tables (`NTD_SERVICE`, `NTD_ENERGY`, and 
`EIA_SEP_REPORT`) together. You should create a table with the following format:

- Each row should be an Agency + Mode Pair
- Each row should include the state in which the Agency is located (per
  the `NTD_SERVICE` table)
- Each row should include all fuel sources from the `NTD_ENERGY` table
- Each row should include the EIA estimated CO2 emissions per MWh from the
  `EIA_SEP_REPORT` table. 

Once this table is created, use a (long-ish) arithmetic formula within a 
`mutate` to compute the total emissions for that row. Note that you will need
additional data to convert combustion fuels to CO2 emissions; these conversions
can be found on [the EIA
website](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php). (You may
hard code these values in your submission. Note that the fuel names used by
the EIA do not exactly match those reported by the NTD; you will need to align
these manually to best effort.)

:::

#### Relate Total Emissions and Passenger Service

Now that you have computed the total emissions for each Agency + Mode pair, it
is time to normalize these by the actual size of the transit agency. *E.g.*, 
the NYC Subway almost certainly has higher total emissions than local bus service
in Ithaca, NY, but it also serves **many** more riders, so the *per capita* 
or *per transit* emissions may be lower. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 6: Normalize Emissions to Transit Usage"}

Using the total emissions calculated above, compute the emissions: 

1) Per UPT; and 
2) Per passenger mile

Which agencies are most efficient on these bases? You may want to filter out
extremely small agencies and to create "small", "medium", and "large" agencies
so that you can give multiple awards. 

Note that transit usage is reported at the Agency level, so you may need to 
sum emissions across multiple modes. 

:::


#### Idenitify 'Greenest' Transit Agencies

With the above analysis, determine the winners of (at least) three GTA IV
awards: 

1) Greenest Transit Agency
2) Most Emissions Avoided
3) A third award of your creation
4) A "Worst Of" award of your creation

The Greenest Transit Agency award can be determined using your analysis above.

For the "Most Emissions Avoided" award, you should first compute the total 
emissions if all transit usage were replaced with driving individual vehicles. 
Then use US [CAFE standards](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/usdot-announces-new-vehicle-fuel-economy-standards-model-year-2024-2026)
to convert miles to gallons of motor fuel used and convert motor fuel to total
emissions as per above. Compare this to the actual emissions associated
with that agency to determine emissions avoided. 

For the third award, determine an additional metric on which a transit agency
can be considered to be highly green (*e.g.*, highest percentage of
electrification) and then determine the appropriate winner. 

Finally, for the fourth award, "name and shame" an agency which does not have
particularly 'green' operations. As with the third award, you can determine
a metric you think is best. 

Per discussion above, you may choose to break these down into multiple
categories (or honorable mention awards) to recognize smaller agencies. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 7: Determine Award Winners"}

Design and implement metrics for the four GTA IV Green Transit Awards and
determine winners. 

:::

## Deliverable: Transit Award "Press Release"

After completing your analysis, prepare a "press release" announcing the
winners in each category. For each award given, your press release should
include at a minimum: 

i)  A short description of the way in which the relevant metric was calculated. 
ii) The winning agency and/or transit mode and the *value* of their metric. 
iii) A 'reference' value that makes the winner look particularly impressive, 
     *e.g.* how did the _median_ agency do on that same metric? 
     
::: {.callout-tip title="Task 8: Visualization"}

For at least two of the four awards, create a suitable visualization demonstrating
the 'green-ness' of the award winners, both in absolute terms and relative to 
other agencies and/or private modes of transporation. 

These should be included in your press release as media supplements that can
be used by, *e.g.*, a local news report in their nightly broadcast. As such, 
these graphics should: 

i)  Have professional-quality ("publication ready") formatting;[^font]
ii) Have low-clutter / high-information density; 
iii) Be self-contained and accessible to a general reader without significant
     additional description retired. 
iv)  Include citations to original data sources used

:::


[^font]: Make sure to set fonts and figure dimensions large enough to be legible
on a large screen.

As with [Mini-Project #01](./mini01.html), you are required to present your 
findings in this format. Because the code implementing this analysis does
not fit naturally in the press release format, you may find it easier to 
style it as an Appendix and to include the press release writing as an
Executive Summary at the top of your submission. 

## Extra Credit Opportunities


Peer evaluators are authorized to give up to 4 points of extra credit (total
across all categories) for 

1) Press release writing that is particularly funny, punny, or otherwise
   enjoyable to read; and 
2) Award criteria that are particularly creative and insight-generating. When
   awarding extra credit, peer evaluators should be sure to assess the quality
   of the insight generated by these additional awards: finding that, *e.g.*,
   the NYC subway is highly efficient on two different but highly correlated
   metrics is not a remarkable insight. 
   
*Additionally*, up to 4 points of extra credit may be given for code that 
automatically reads the [EIA Fuel Type
Emissions](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php) estimates
automatically instead of hard-coding values. Note that full credit may be given
for analysis which hard-codes these EPA estimates: reading and manipulating
web data like this is not required until the end of this course. 
[^mwh]: 1 Megawatt-hour (MWh) is 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) or roughly enough
to power 3 NYC appartments for one month. Electricity bills are typically cited
in kWh; to convert the per MWh price reported here to a per kWh price divide by
1000.
