## Introduction

Welcome to Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}! In this project, you will dive
into the world of music analytics in an attempt to create **The Ultimate
Playlist.** Specifically, we will explore two data exports made available
by Spotify to identify i) the most popular songs on the platform and ii) the
characteristics of those songs. From this data, you will create the ultimate
playlist. Note that, while this project is inspired by the work of the [Great Sage, Mr Barney 
Stinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gjcVD3D1s), pioneer of the 
"All Rise" playlist, you can create whatever type of playlist you want, as
long as it is **Ultimate**. 

Also note that this mini-project is intended to be a bit less demanding than
[Mini-Project #02](./mini02.html). At this point in the course, you should be
diving into your [Course Project](../project.html), which should consume the
majority of your out-of-class time dedicated to this course for the remainder of
the semester.


### Student Responsbilities

Recall our basic analytic workflow and table of student responsibilities:

-   Data Ingest and Cleaning: Given a single data source, read it into `R` and transform it to a reasonably useful standardized format.
-   Data Combination and Alignment: Combine multiple data sources to enable insights not possible from a single source.
-   Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Take a data table and compute informative summary statistics from both the entire population and relevant subgroups
-   Data Visualization: Generate insightful data visualizations to spur insights not attainable from point statistics
-   Inferential Statistical Analysis and Modeling: Develop relevant predictive models and statistical analyses to generate insights about the *underlying population* and not simply the data at hand.

In this project, I am no longer providing code to download and read the necessary data files. The data files I have selected for this mini-project are relatively easy to work with and should not provide a significant challenge, particularly after our in-class discussion of Data Import. See the modified rubric below which now includes a grade for data import.

### Rubric

{{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects are evaluated using *peer grading* with *meta-review* by the course GTAs. Specifically, variants of the following rubric will be used for the mini-projects:

: Mini-Project Grading Rubric

Note that this rubric is designed with copious opportunities for extra credit if students go *above and beyond* the instructor-provided scaffolding. Students pursuing careers in data analytics are strongly encouraged to go beyond the strict ambit of the mini-projects to i) further refine their skills; ii) learn additional techniques that can be used in the final course project; and iii) develop a more impressive professional portfolio.

Because students are encouraged to use {{< var course.short >}} mini-projects as the basis for a professional portfolio, the basic skeleton of each project will be released under a fairly permissive usage license. Take advantage of it!

### Submission Instructions

After completing the analysis, write up your findings, *showing all of 
your code*, using a dynamic `quarto` document and post it to your course
repository. The `qmd` file should be named `{r} I(mp_file$qmd)` so the rendered
document can be found at `{r} I(mp_file$html_long)` in the student's repository
and served at the URL:[^sub]

> `https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp{{< meta mp_num >}}.html`

Once the submission deadline passes, the instructor will tag classmates
for peer feedback in this issue thread.

*Additionally*, a PDF export of this report should be submitted on Brightspace.
To create a PDF from the uploaded report, simply use your browser's 'Print to PDF'

**NB**: The analysis outline below specifies key *tasks* you need to perform
within your write up. Your peer evaluators will check that you complete these.
You are encouraged to do extra analysis, but the bolded **Tasks** are *mandatory*.

**NB**: Your final submission should look like a *report*, not simply a list
of facts answering questions. Add introductions, conclusions, and your own
commentary. You should be practicing both raw *coding* skills and written
*communication* in all mini-projects. There is little value in data points
stated without context or motivation.


[^sub]: Throughout this section, replace `<GITHUB_ID>` with your GitHub ID from
[Mini-Project #00](./mini00.html), making sure to remove the angle brackets. Note
that the automated course infrastructure will be looking for precise formatting,
so follow these instructions closely. 


## Mini-Project #{{< meta mp_num >}}: {{< meta mp_title >}}

### Data Acquisition

We will use two Spotify data exports: 

1) A data set of songs and their characteristics
2) An export of user-created playlists

Interestingly, Spotify no longer makes these datasets available directly, but
nothing ever leaves the internet and we can use mirrors of the original data
posted by other data scientists. 

### Song Characteristics

First, we can download the song properties data from the mirror posted by
GitHub user **gabminamendez**. Download the data and import it into `R`. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 1: Song Characteristics Dataset"}

Write a function called `load_songs` to 

  i)  download the Spotify song analytics dataset (if needed) from
      [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabminamedez/spotify-data/refs/heads/master/data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabminamedez/spotify-data/refs/heads/master/data.csv)
  ii) read it into `R`. 
  
Your function should return a well-formatted data frame. 

To be responsible, your download code should: 

1) Only download the file if it is not already present
2) Create a directory titled `data/mp03` if one is not already present
3) Save the file in `data/mp03` and, if necessary, decompress it. 
4) Use built-in `R` functions like `download.file`

See prior mini-projects for examples of responsible downloading code.  

:::

The `artists` column of this data set is a bit oddly formatted: it contains
multiple artists in a "list-type" format: *e.g.*, the song "Blinding Lights"
has `artists` as `['The Weeknd']` and the song "Uptown Funk (feat. Bruno Mars)"
has `artists` as `['Mark Ronson', 'Bruno Mars']`. The following code will split
the `artists` across multiple rows, yielding *e.g.*, two rows for Uptown Funk,
one each for Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. 

```{r}
#| eval: false 
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
clean_artist_string <- function(x){
    x |>
    str_replace_all("\\['", "") |>
    str_replace_all("'\\]", "") |>
    str_replace_all("[ ]?'", "") |>
    str_replace_all("[ ]*,[ ]*", ",") 
}
SONGS |> 
  separate_longer_delim(artists, ",") |>
  mutate(artist = clean_artist_string(artists)) |>
  select(-artists)
```

Adapt it as needed for your analysis.

### Playlists 

Next, we'll download the Spotify Million Playlist dataset from GitHub user
**DevinOgrady**. Because this dataset is large, **DevinOgrady** has uploaded
it as a series of JSON files in his
[`spotify_million_playlist_dataset`](https://github.com/DevinOgrady/spotify_million_playlist_dataset/tree/main)
repository. Write a function to download all files from this repository
(`data1` directory), store them locally, and read them into `R`. As above,
your download function should be responsible (only downloading the data once
as needed). 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 2: Playlist Dataset"}


Write a function called `load_playlists` to 

  i)  download the Spotify million playlist dataset (if needed);
  ii) read all files into `R`; and
  iii) concatenate them into a list object. 
  
As before, your download code should be "responsible" and avoid unnecessary
duplicate downloads. (If your code is not 'responsible', GitHub may put a
short-term block up to stop you from making too many requests. Be careful!)

You **may not** hard-code invidual file names. You need to use a loop-type
construct and create individual file names programmatically. 

:::

Unlike the song characteristics data, this is *hierarchical* data, not
trivially represented as a tidy data frame. To proceed we will need to 
process the playlists data into a more standard format. In particular, we 
want a table of the following columns:

- Playlist Name (`playlist_name`)
- Playlist ID (`playlist_id`)
- Playlist Position (`playlist_position`)
- Playlist Followers (`playlist_followers`)
- Artist Name (`artist_name`)
- Artist ID (`artist_id`)
- Track Name (`track_name`)
- Track ID (`track_id`)
- Album Name (`album_name`)
- Album ID (`album_id`)
- Duration (`duration`)

where each row is one "track" from a playlist. (Certain songs will be repeated
because they appear on multiple playlists.)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 3: 'Rectangle' the Playlist Data"}

Using functions from the `tidyr`, `purrr`, and `dplyr` packages, convert
the playlist data from Task 2 into the rectangular format described above. 

To clean up the ID columns, you can use the following function to strip the
`spotify:type:` prefix. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
strip_spotify_prefix <- function(x){
    library(stringr)
    str_extract(x, ".*:.*:(.*)", group=1)
}
```

:::

### Initial Exploration

Now that your data is imported and cleaned, it is time to begin exploring
it and seeing how comprehensive it is. (Note that these exports were created
at different times, so they will not have fully overlapping coverage.)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 4: Initial Exploration"}

1. How many distinct tracks and artists are represented in the playlist data? 
2. What are the 5 most popular tracks in the playlist data? 
3. What is the most popular track in the playlist data that *does not have a
   corresponding entry in the song characteristics* data? 
4. According to the song characteristics data, what is the most "danceable" 
   track? How often does it appear in a playlist? 
5. Which playlist has the longest average track length?
6. What is the most popular playlist on Spotify? 

:::

### Identifying Characteristics of Popular Songs

::: {.callout-note title="Inner Join to Combine Data Sets"}

For the remainder of this assignment, I recommend using an `inner_join` to
combine the playlist and song characteristic data sets. This will throw out
a (potentially large) fraction the playlist data, but given the timing and
construction of these data exports, it is the best we can do.

:::

Next, we will *visually* explore this data, with an eye towards finding 
characteristics of the most popular songs on Spotify. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 5: Visually Identifying Characteristics of Popular Songs"}

Answer the following questions using one or more visualizations. Make sure
your plots are "publication-quality", with well-formatted axes, color schemes,
*etc.*

1. Is the `popularity` column correlated with the number of playlist 
   appearances? If so, to what degree? 
   
   For the following questions, select a threshold that defines a "popular"
   song. There's no 'right' answer here, but I would recommend finding a song
   that is right "at the line" of being popular *per* your threshold and seeing
   if you consider it "almost popular." If it's a very popular song, adjust
   your threshold lower; if it's obscure, adjust your threshold higher. 
2. In what year were the most popular songs released? 
3. In what year did danceability peak? 
4. Which decade is most represented on user playlists? (The integer
   division (`%/%`) operator may be useful for computing decades from
   years.)
5. Create a plot of key frequency among songs. Because musical keys exist in
   a 'cycle', your plot should use polar (circular) coordinates. 
6. What are the most popular track lengths? (Are short tracks, long tracks,
   or something in between most commonly included in user playlists?)
7. Pose and visually answer at least two more other exploratory questions.
:::

Note that you can answer many of these using `dplyr` functions only, but
a learning objective of this mini-project is to practice creating informative
visualizations, so you are required to include at least one plot for each of
these questions. If helpful, you can validate your visual findings with a 
descriptive statistic: *e.g.*, if your plot shows a positive correlation between
track length and popularity, you can also compute this correlation numerically
and include it in your text. 

### Building a Playlist from Anchor Songs

To begin building your playlist, pick one or two "anchor" songs that you 
like. (You can adjust these if you don't like how your playlist comes out.)

You can find songs that work well in a playlist with these songs using
various heuristics: 

1) What other songs commonly appear on playlists along side this song? 

2) What other songs are in the same key[^key] and have a similar tempo? 
   (This makes it easy for a skilled DJ to transition from one song to the
    next.)

3) What other songs were released by the same artist? 

4) What other songs were released in the same year and have similar
   levels of `acousticness`, `danceability`, *etc.*? 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 6: Finding Related Songs"}

Implement the four heuristics above plus one of your own to find potential
songs that belong on a playlist with your anchor songs. You should identify
at least 20 candidates, at least 8 of which are not "popular" based on the
threshold you set above. 

:::

### Create Your Playlist

Given your anchor songs and playlist candidates, it is now time to filter 
down to a playlist of around 12 songs, suitably ordered. Using all the
data available to you, determine an optimal playlist. Your playlist should
include at least 2 songs you were not previously familiar with and at least 3 
which are not "popular."

Once you have created your playlist, visualize its evolution on the various
quantitative metrics Spotify provides. Does it, *per Stinson*, 'rise and fall'
or is it 'all rise'? 

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 7: Curate and Analyze Your Ultimate Playlist"}

Curate and Analyze the Ultimate Playlist per instructions above. In addition
to its musical structure, make sure to consider thematic unity, *e.g.*, songs
about cars, and to give your playlist a creative name.

:::

## Deliverable: The Ultimate Playlist

Now that you have created the Ultimate Playlist, it is time to nominate it
for the Internet's Best Playlist award. Write a title, description, and
"design principles" for your playlist. Make sure to include at least
one visualization that argues why your playlist is Ultimate. Describe how
you used statistical and visual analysis to create this playlist, taking
pride to showcase lesser known pieces that are integral to your playlist
structure. 

## Extra Credit

In addition to the rubric-specified extra credit, extra credit may be given
for the following: 

- Up to 2 points: use of Quarto's [video
  support](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html) to embed recordings
  of tracks from the playlist. 


[^key]: As coded by the `key` column, 0 is C, 1 is C#, 2 is D, *etc.* For 
non-musicians, this just means that the two songs share some harmonic structure
that makes it easy to tie them together.
