Welcome to the course website for {{< var course.short >}} 
({{< var course.semester >}})!

{{< var course.short >}} is an _Introduction to R_ targeted at students in the 
[MS in Business Analytics](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/masters-in-business-analytics/), 
[MS in Statistics](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/statistics/), 
and [MS in Quantitative Methods](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/quantitative-methods-modeling/) 
programs. 

This site hosts the unofficial [Course Syllabus](./syllabus.html), 
[Course Policies](./resources.html), and [Course Learning Objectives](./objectives.html).

Official copies of these documents can be found on [CUNY Brightspace](https://brightspace.cuny.edu).
Course [pre-assignments](./preassigns.html), [labs](./labs.html), and 
[mini-projects](./miniprojects.html) can also be found on this site.

This offering of {{< var course.short >}} will be taught in a mixture of the
*flipped-classroom* and  *experiential-learning* formats. Roughly, this means
that most weeks, students will be asked to complete a small [_pre-assignment_](./preassignments.html) 
each week to introduce the core concept(s) covered in that week's lecture.
Each class period will be split between a brief lecture covering concepts in more
detail and an extended [_lab activity_](./labs.html) designed to build
familiarity and fluency with that week's subject matter. 

There are quite a few moving parts to this course, so this [key dates file](./key_dates.csv)
or the list of upcoming course activities below may be useful:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(glue)
variables <- read_yaml("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750/refs/heads/main/_variables.yml")
course_repo  <- variables$course$repo
course_short <- variables$course$short

readr::read_csv("key_dates.csv") |>

    DT::datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE,
                               paging=TRUE),
                  caption=glue("Upcoming Important Dates for {course_short}"))
```

<script defer>
window.addEventListener("load", function(){
  var filter_date = new Date();
  filter_date.setDate(filter_date.getDate() - 1);
  var filter_string = filter_date.toISOString().split('T')[0]
  $("table").DataTable().rows((idx, data) => data[4] < filter_string).remove().draw();
});
</script>

If you use another calendar system that cannot accept CSV files in this format, 
let me know and I will try to provide additional file formats.
