## Course Resources

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (R4DS) is an excellent free
textbook covering much of the material of this course.

The [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org) packages used throughout this course
have excellent documentation:

- [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org)
- [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)
- [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org)
- [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- [`rvest`](https://rvest.tidyverse.org)


The [`quarto` guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) is particularly useful.

Students may also benefit from the [Unofficial Solutions for R4DS](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/), 
the [Posit R Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/), 
[Statistical Infernece via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/), and the book
[Elegrant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/). 

The book [*Happy Git with R*](https://happygitwithr.com/) is particularly useful
for `git` usage. General `git` usage is also covered by the 
[Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

The book [*Veridical Data Science*](https://vdsbook.com/) by Yu and Barter has lots
of useful advice on applied data analytics that may help with the course project. 

Students are encouraged to ask the instructor for additional resources as needed. 

### GitHub Resources

After you create your GitHub account in [Mini-Project 
 #00](./miniprojects/mini00.html), you should register for the [GitHub Student
Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). This will give you increased
GitHub functionality as well as free access to [GitHub 
CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), a coding assistance tool that
students in previous offerings of this course have found helpful.

The Student Developer Pack also gives you access to several helpful online
tutorials, including GitHub's official [Understanding
Markdown](https://education.github.com/experiences/understanding_markdown) and
[Intro to GitHub](https://education.github.com/experiences/intro_to_github)
courses. 


### Course Discussion Board

{{< var course.short >}} will use `Piazza` as the course discussion board.
Students are encouraged to direct all questions about course topics or logistics
to Piazza; use of a public anonymous discussion board allows students to benefit
from the insights of their classmates and allows instructors to answer questions
publicly to the benefit of all students. 

Students are encouraged to use Piazza's private question feature if they need to
contact the instructor directly. Please only use private questions for personal
inquiries: questions about the technical substance of the course can and should
be asked (pseudonymously) in the public section of Piazza. 

Piazza login information will be distributed through CUNY Brightspace.

### Communication Resources

Written and oral communication is an important element of this course. 

The [Baruch Writing Center](https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/writingcenter/) offers
free support to all Baruch students; students can meet with a professional writing
consultant one-to-one (in person, in NVC 8-185, or online, by video, audio, and
text-based chat) and in group workshops. Writing Center consultants will work
collaboratively with you to deepen your writing and English language skills.
At any step in the process, they’ll help you become a more independent, confident,
and versatile writer.[^0]

Baruch's [Tools for Clear Speech](https://tfcs.baruch.cuny.edu/) program improves
the pronunciation, fluency, and pragmatic abilities of English language learners
and non-native English speakers at Baruch College.  TfCS participants achieve more
effective and intelligible communication, developing skills that empower them
to succeed in their classrooms, careers, and beyond. TfCS offers a range of free
face-to-face and online services with our professional Speech Consultants,
including One-to-One Sessions, small-group Focused Skills Series sessions,
large-group Overview Workshops, interview and career preparation, and weekly
Conversation Hours.

### Computing Resources

All software used in this course is [Free and Open-Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) that can be installed on your personal machine without cost. Students will need to install, at a minimum, 

- [`R`](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
- [`rstudio` Desktop Edition](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

Thanks to the [Binder project](https://mybinder.org/), we are also able to provide free _virtual machines_ equipped with all course software pre-installed:

- [RStudio](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelweylandt/STA9750/main?urlpath=rstudio)
- [Command Line Access](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelweylandt/STA9750/main)

CUNY also provides a Windows-based RStudio virtual machine through [Apporto](https://cuny.apporto.com/).

Please note that these are _transient instances_ and any work saved on these 
machines may be lost without warning. 

### Helper Functions

Several "helper" functions may be found [here](./tips.html). These include 
functionality to verify that assignments and feedback have been properly
submitted on GitHub, to count words on a page, *etc.* Note that these are a new
addition to this course, so please contact the instructor if they do not appear
to be working properly.

## Course Policies

### Academic Integrity Policy

I fully support CUNY’s [Policy on Academic
Integrity](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/08/CUNY-Academic-Integrity-Policy-2024.pdf),
which states, in part:

> Academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York. Penalties for 
  academic dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise
  reduced grades, and/or disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion.

> Academic integrity is at the core of a college or university education. Faculty
  assign essays, exams, quizzes, projects, and so on both to extend the learning 
  done in the classroom and as a means of assessing that learning. When students 
  violate the academic integrity policy (i.e., "cheat"), they are committing an
  act of theft that can cause real harm to themselves and others including, but
  not limited to, their classmates, their faculty, and the caregivers who may be
  funding their education. Academic dishonesty confers an unfair advantage over
  others, which undermines educational equity and fairness. Students who cheat
  place their college’s accreditation and their own future prospects in jeopardy.

Academic sanctions in this class will range from an **F on the Assignment** to
an **F in this Course**. A report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent
to the Office of the Dean of Students. 

Students are encouraged to contact the instructor with any questions or concerns
related to matters of academic integrity.


### External Resources Use Policy

For the coding elements of this course, students are encouraged to use freely
available online resources, including question-and-answer fora such as StackOverflow.
You may also use AI-driven developer tools such as GitHub Co-Pilot. Paid services
are not allowed. On each assignment, you will be asked to list external resources
used on each assignment. You are ultimately responsible for the correctness of any
submitted materials - "the AI told me so"" is not a valid defense.

*Note on ChatGPT and Related Large-Language Models*: You **may** use 
large-language models to complete any assignment in this course *in a 
limited fashion*. Specifically, you may use tools where you describe a 
coding objective in natural language and receive (pseudo-)code output. 
However, you should only use the tools to achieve specific coding aims; 
you **may not** feed them the course assignment whole and expect them to
complete the assignment for you. While these tools are powerful, and often
superficially accurate, for this task, using them in this manner will undermine
the [learning objectives](./objectives.html) of this course.

- *Good*: Hi ChatGPT, how can use `ggplot2` to create a scatterplot with a 
  linear trend, but skip weekdays on my $x$-axis?

- *Bad*: Hi ChatGPT, please visualize this data for me. 

Additionally, you **may not** use any Generative AI tools for the mini-project
peer evaluation cycles. 

For the written elements of this course (_e.g._ Project Final Report), standard
academic expectations of attribution and citation are in place. This will be
covered in more detail in the course project documents. 

Students are _highly encouraged_ to collaborate on homework assignments, but
each student is required to individually and complete each assignment. If
substantially identical assignments are submitted, the instructor may require
each student to individually demonstrate their understanding of the material.
Collaborators should be listed at the end of each submitted assignment along with
a statement of contributions.

### Unexcused Abscence Policy

Attendance is not required, but lecture recordings may not be provided.
Students are responsible for the content of all sessions missed.

### Late Work Policy {#late-work-policy}

Late work will not be accepted except in extraordinary and unforeseeable
circumstances. Students submitting late work should provide supporting documentation
to the Office of the Dean of Students; ODS will provide the instructor with a letter
authorizing late work submission as appropriate. 

All assignment submission technology used in this course allows
multiple submissions, so students are encouraged to submit early and often
to avoid any technology troubles associated with late submission. 

Note that late work is allowed consistent with specific pre-arranged
course accommodations as noted below.

### Communication Policy

Students should use the course discussion board for all course-related
communication. Technical questions, that is, questions either about the course
material or asking for help with an issue specific to your computer, should
always be asked as "Public" and visible to the entire class. Even if you think
an issue is too specific to be of broad interest, it is almost certain that one
of your classmates has a very similar issue and will benefit from your question.
Before posting a new question, students should review previous questions and, if
appropriate, post their question as a follow-up discussion to relevant prior
answers. If your question is large enough to merit a new question, but is similar
to a previous question, please reference the prior post so the instructor knows
that you have already read that question. Failure to do this may result in an
sub-optimal answer (*e.g.*, "go read XYZ"). 

Questions should only be marked as private if they are personal or sensitive, 
*e.g.*, specific questions about grading, request for religious or medical 
accomodation, or discussion of interpersonal conflicts. Questions of potential
broad interest inapporiately marked as private, or sent via email, will be 
closed by the instructor and the student
will be asked to re-post their question publically. 

You should take full advantage of the course discussion board to discuss anything
of interest related to this course: in addition to diving deeper into course
material, please bring in connections to other courses, discussion of news or
cutting-edge research, or general questions about your studies and careers as
data scientists. The most valuable aspects of your education at Baruch are the
connections and community you develop with your classmates and with your faculty.

The instructor will attempt (but not guarantee) to respond within **two business
days** of all student posts.[^onebd] Consequently, if you have a complex issue
requiring significant back-and-forth to resolve, you need to ask for help early. 
In particular, you should submit your mini-projects early and often to 
identify-and hopefully resolve-any technology issues as quickly as possible. 

Be sure to keep your interactions in all course fora helpful, respectful, and
professional. Inappropriate or unpressional postings will be deleted and grade
penalties will be applied for particularly inappropriate interactions. Your
classmates have a wide range of technical background - what is obvious to you
may be difficult for them - so do not be overly curt.

[^onebd]: As a general rule, I do not check the course discussion boards regularly
over weekends or CUNY holidays and you should not expect a rapid response during
these periods.

## Care Resources for Students[^1]

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this
semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting
enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your
goals and cope with stress. 

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone.
Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. 

This course is intended to be **demanding**, but not **difficult**. If you feel
like you are struggling, please reach out sooner rather than later.
Swimming long-distances in choppy waters builds strength: drowning doesn't.

### Mental Health Resources

If you or anyone you know experiences significant academic stress, difficult
life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you
to seek support.

The [Baruch Counselling Center](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/counseling/)
is here to help. You can visit them in person at 137 E 25th St, 9th floor
or call them at [646-312-2155](tel:646-312-2155) during normal business hours;
you can make an appointment online
[here](https://baruch.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a4NCaYrV2Sk1cyg). For more
immediate support, please call NYC WELL ([1-888-NYC-WELL](tel:1-888-NYC-WELL) or [1-888-692-9355](tel:1-888-692-9355)). 

Asking for help is often difficult: consider reaching out to a friend,
family, or a member of the faculty you trust for help getting connected to
support that can help. 

If you are worried about a friend or classmate, consider reaching out to the
[Baruch Campus Intervention 
Team](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/campus-intervention-team/).

### Physical Health

[Healthy CUNY](https://www.healthycuny.org/) promotes well-being and a culture
of health in order to foster the academic and life success of all CUNY students.
They can connect you with a variety of [campus-](https://www.healthycuny.org/cuny-health-centers)
and [community](https://www.healthycuny.org/community-health-resources)-based
healthcare providers. 

[Baruch Health Services](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/health/)
provides students with a full range of clinical health services. Call
