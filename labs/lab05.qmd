# Review Practice {#review}

The file ["births.csv"](https://github.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750/blob/main/births.csv) 
in the course repository contains daily US birth counts for 20 years from 1969
to 1988, obtained from the US Social Security Administration. Download this file
and read it into `R` and answer the following review questions with your group. 

The following code may be useful: 

```{webr}
if(!file.exists("births.csv")){
    download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750/main/births.csv", 
                  destfile="births.csv")
}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

births <- read_csv("births.csv")
glimpse(births)
```

The columns here are:

- `id` : The day in the entire time series (going up to $\approx 365 * 20$ plus a few for leap day)
- `day_of_year`: the day in the year (1 to 365/366)
- `day_of_week`: the day of the week, coded as an integer
- `day`, `month`, `year`: the parts of the date as we normally think of them
- `births`: the number of births that day. 


1. How many children were born on January 1st, 1984? 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}

```{webr}
#| eval: true
births |> filter(day==1, month==1, year==1984)
```

:::

2. How many total children were born in 1984? 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}

```{webr}
births |> filter(year==1984) |> summarize(sum(births))
```

:::

3. How many children were born each year? (Print a 20 row table)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}

```{webr}
births |> group_by(year) |> summarize(n_births = sum(births))
```

:::

4. How many more children were born each year than the preceeding? 
(The `lag` function will be useful here!)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}

```{webr}
births |> 
    group_by(year) |>
    summarize(n_births = sum(births)) |>
    mutate(increase_births = n_births - lag(n_births))
```

:::

5. On average, in what month are the most children born? 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}

```{webr}
births |> 
    group_by(month) |>
    summarize(avg_births = mean(births)) |>
    slice_max(avg_births)
```

After completing these, work with your group to formulate and answer three more
advanced questions with your group.

# Multi Table Operations

This week, we are going to dive into the most useful "multi-table" `dplyr`
operations, the `join` family. We will focus on the "big two" joins: 

- `inner_join`
- `left_join`

These inspired by the `SQL` joins, `INNER JOIN` and`LEFT JOIN`.[^1] We will 
apply them to the various tables in the `nycflights13` data set. Recall the 
structure of each of these tables: 

```{webr}
library(nycflights13)
glimpse(flights)
```

```{webr}
glimpse(airlines)
```

```{webr}
glimpse(airports)
```

```{webr}
glimpse(planes)
```

```{webr}
glimpse(weather)
```

From here, we can see that there are many relationships between these tables. For
example, the `origin` and `dest` columns of the `flights` table, representing
the origin and destination airport respectively, both correspond to the FAA
identifiers used by the `faa` column of the `airports` table. These "commonalities"
form the basis of join specifications. 

## Join Specifications

`dplyr` specifies joins using the `join_by` function. The output of the `join_by`
function, also known as a "join specification" is a series of logical tests
applied to pairs of rows. The results of these logical tests are used to identify
"matches" between rows. Joins differ primarily on how they use the outputs of
these logical tests to construct their output. 

The simplest and most useful logical test to use in a join is an equality test. 
In `dplyr`, these are simply written as

```{webr}
join_by(left_name == right_name)
```

This type of test checks whether the value in the `left_name` column of the 
first (left) argument matches the value in the `right_name` column of the second
(right) argument. 

For example, if I wanted to join the `origin` column of `flights` table to the
`faa` column of the `airports` table, I might use something like the following: 

```{webr}
inner_join(flights, airports, join_by(origin == faa))
```

Here `origin` is taken to be a column from the first (left) table and `faa`
is taken to be a column from the second (right) table. As with other `dplyr`
functions, there is a bit of programming magic used to allow column names
to be used as variables and interpreted correctly. 

For the airport identifiers, we only need to match on the single unique ID. (We
can assume the FAA assigns unique IDs to each airport.) In other circumstances,
we need to combine several logical tests to get a true match. 

For example, suppose we want to align our flights with the weather at their 
origin airport at scheduled take off time. Here, we'd need to combine the `flights`
and `weather` table on _many_ columns: 

- `origin` to `origin`
- `year` to `year`
- `month` to `month`
- `day` to `day`
- `hour` to `hour`

In this case, we'd pass 5 equality conditions to `join_by`: 

```{webr}
inner_join(flights, 
           weather, 
           join_by(origin == origin,
                   year == year,
                   month == month,
                   day == day,
                   hour == hour))
```

Here we look only at those rows which match on _all 5_ tests. In this way,
`join_by` behaves like `filter`: it "passes" the _intersection_ of positive
results. 

Note that it is relatively common for matched columns to have the same name in
both tables: to support this case, `dplyr` reads a single column name as "self-equality". So the above code can be more concisely written as: 

```{webr}
inner_join(flights, 
           weather, 
           join_by(origin, 
                   year, 
                   month, 
                   day, 
                   hour))
```

I recommend _against_ using this short-cut. It takes hardly more time to write
your intent explicitly and it's far more robust. _Measure twice, cut once_. 

Unfortunately, it is not easy to perform an "OR" in `join_by`. We may cover this
below, time allowing. 

We now turn to specific joins. All of these joins use the `join_by` operator
but they construct results differently based on its output.

::: {.callout-note title="Doubling Names"}

Note that `data.frame`s cannot have multiple columns with the same name. If a 
name is duplicated coming out of a join, `dplyr` will add `.x` and `.y` to 
the column names: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    inner_join(airlines, join_by(carrier == carrier)) |> 
    inner_join(airports, join_by(origin == faa)) 
```

Here the output has two `name` columns: one from `airlines`, the name of the airline, 
and one from `airports`, the name of the origin airport. To resolve this
ambiguity, the columns are automatically renamed to `name.x`, coming from the
first table, here `airlines` and `name.y`, coming from the second table, 
here `airports`. If you want to change these suffixes, you can provide them
explicitly: 

```{webr}
flights |> 
    inner_join(airlines, join_by(carrier == carrier)) |> 
    inner_join(airports, 
               join_by(origin == faa), 
               suffix = c("_airline", "_origin_airport")) 
```

Now we get `name_airline` and `name_origin_airport` instead, which may be easier
to use. They are certainly clearer to read. 

:::

## Inner Joins

The most common and most important join in data analysis is the `inner_join`.
The inner join returns _matches_ between two tables. Conceptually, the inner
join constructs all possible pairs of rows between the two tables (so 
`NROW(x) * NROW(y)` total rows) and then filters down to 
those which pass the `join_by` test. In practice, more efficient algorithms 
are used to prevent wasteful computation. 

Inner joins are used when seeking matches between two tables. They are particularly
useful when both tables are "comprehensive" and we are sure that there are matches. 
For instance, we can use an `inner_join` to combine most of the tables in
`nycflights13` because they come from a comprehensive government data source.
(*E.g.*, No flights going to secret "unauthorized" airports.)

Let's start by asking what the _average_ arrival delay of flights going to
west coast airports is. We do not have enough information to answer this using
the `flights` table alone. To identify west coast airports, let's filter
`airports` on `tzone`: 

```{webr}
west_coast_airports <- airports |> filter(tzone == "America/Los_Angeles")
```

We can now join this to the original flights table to find only those flights
with destination matches in `west_coast_airports`:

```{webr}
inner_join(flights, west_coast_airports, join_by(dest == faa))
```

Here, we have only a subset of our original `flights` table. From this, we
can compute our relevant summary statistic: 

```{webr}
inner_join(flights, west_coast_airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |>
    summarize(mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Is this any better than the following alternative approach: 

```{webr}
inner_join(flights, airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |>
    filter(tzone == "America/Los_Angeles") |>
    drop_na() |>
    summarize(mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Formally, these are basically equivalent. (`filter` and `inner_join` _commute_). 
As usual, it's a matter of _communicating intent_. Here the single line 
`filter(tzone == "America/Los_Angeles")` is simple enough it probably doesn't
need a separate variable. But if, instead of a one line operation, we performed
a very complex set of filtering options, we may benefit from giving it a separate
name as opposed to trying to shoe-horn the complex filtering into a pipeline. 

Performance-wise, it is a bit better to perform `filter` before `inner_join` 
(Why? Think about the size of the result of each step.) but the difference is
rarely material. _Clarity of intent_, not _optimizing performance_, should dictate
the order in which you perform steps. 

Both approaches are also equivalent to: 

```{webr}
inner_join(flights, 
           airports |> filter(tzone == "America/Los_Angeles"), 
           join_by(dest == faa)) |>
    drop_na() |>
    summarize(mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

But I find this sort of "`filter` inside `join` argument" to be terribly
difficult to read: it mixes standard (inside-out) and piped (left to right)
evaluation orders in a confusing manner. Avoid this!

Work with your group to answer the following questions using `inner_join`. 

1.  What is the name of the airline with the longest average departure delay?

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        group_by(carrier) |> 
        summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        inner_join(airlines, join_by(carrier == carrier)) |> 
        slice_max(name) |> 
        pull(name)
    ```
    
    :::

2.  What is the name of the origin airport with the longest average departure delay?

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        group_by(origin) |> 
        summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        inner_join(airports, join_by(origin == faa)) |> 
        slice_max(name) |> 
        pull(name)
    ```
    
    :::

3.  What is the name of the destination airport with the longest average departure delay?

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        group_by(dest) |> 
        summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        inner_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |> 
        slice_max(name) |> 
        pull(name)
    ```
    
    :::

4.  Are average delays longer for East-coast destinations or West-coast destinations?

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    To answer this, let's define East/West coast by time zones. 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        group_by(dest) |> 
        summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        inner_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |> 
        group_by(tzone) |> 
        summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(mean_dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        filter(tzone %in% c("America/New_York", "America/Los_Angeles")) |> 
        slice_max(mean_dep_delay) |> 
        pull(tzone)
    ```
    
    So it looks like East Coast flights actually do take off a bit later on
    average. 
    
    This analysis is not quite right however as it treats all airports as being
    equally important when computing the time zone averages, instead of 
    weighting them by total number of flights. To do this properly, we should
    probably keep track of i) the number of flights to each airport; and ii)
    the total minutes of delays to that airport. Putting these together, we'll 
    be able to appropriately weight our answers. 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        group_by(dest) |> 
        summarize(total_dep_delay = sum(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE), 
                  n_flights = n()) |> 
        inner_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |> 
        group_by(tzone) |> 
        summarize(total_dep_delay = sum(total_dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE), 
                  n_flights = sum(n_flights)) |> 
        filter(tzone %in% c("America/New_York", "America/Los_Angeles")) |> 
        mutate(mean_dep_delay = total_dep_delay / n_flights) |> 
        slice_max(mean_dep_delay) |> 
        pull(tzone)
    ```
    
    In this case, the answer doesn't actually change, but it's good to know we
    did the right thing. 
    
    :::

5.  Which plane (`tailnum`) flew the most times leaving NYC? Who manufactured it?

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        filter(!is.na(tailnum)) |> 
        group_by(tailnum) |> 
        summarize(n_flights = n()) |> 
        slice_max(n_flights) |> 
        inner_join(planes, join_by(tailnum == tailnum))
    ```
    
    Hmmm.... That's odd. Let's see if we can figure out what happened. 
    
    Whenever we get back a zero row join result, it's usually a sign that the
    quantity (key) being joined doesn't exist in both tables. We can verify this
    manually: 
    
    ```{webr}
    top_tailnum <- flights |> 
        filter(!is.na(tailnum)) |> 
        group_by(tailnum) |> 
        summarize(n_flights = n()) |> 
        slice_max(n_flights) |> 
        pull(tailnum)
    ```
    
    and
    
    ```{webr}
    top_tailnum %in% (planes |> pull(tailnum))
    ```
    
    How should we deal with this? Two options: 
    
    1) We can acknowledge that it's a frequently used plane with
       missing information, likely because it's a private plane; and/or
    2) We can modify our analysis to instead return the most common plane 
       _for which we have info_. 
       
    To do the latter, we need to move our filtering to _after_ the join: 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        filter(!is.na(tailnum)) |> 
        group_by(tailnum) |> 
        summarize(n_flights = n()) |> 
        inner_join(planes, join_by(tailnum == tailnum)) |> 
        slice_max(n_flights) |> 
        select(tailnum, manufacturer) 
    ```
    
    Note that the use of an `inner_join` here guarantees us that our selected
    `tailnum` is indeed one for which we have information. 
    
    :::


6.  Which manufacturer has the most planes flying out of NYC airports? 

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    There is a bit of ambiguity, but if we interpret as the most _flights_
    per manufacturer, we get the following: 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        inner_join(planes, join_by(tailnum == tailnum)) |> 
        count(manufacturer) |> 
        slice_max(n) |> 
        pull(manufacturer)
    ```
    
    If instead we look just at pure plane count, treating all planes as equal
    even if they only departed NYC once, we could instead: 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        distinct(tailnum) |> 
        inner_join(planes, join_by(tailnum == tailnum)) |> 
        count(manufacturer) |> 
        slice_max(n) |> 
        pull(manufacturer)
    ```
    
    :::

7.  Which manufacturer has the longest average flight? 

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    As with the earlier question about timezones, there is a bit of ambiguity
    in how we want to interpret this -- should `longest` be interpreted as time
    or distance? -- but the answer is something like the following: 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        inner_join(planes, join_by(tailnum == tailnum)) |> 
        group_by(manufacturer) |> 
        summarize(mean_air_time = mean(air_time, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        slice_max(mean_air_time) |> 
        pull(manufacturer)
    ```
    
    :::
    
8.  What model of plane has the smallest average delay leaving NYC?

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    Something like: 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        inner_join(planes, join_by(tailnum == tailnum)) |> 
        group_by(model) |> 
        summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        slice_max(mean_dep_delay) |> 
        pull(model)
    ```
    
    though as before there is some ambiguity in how we should weight the average.
    
    :::

## Left Join

Left joins are useful when you don't want to dropped unmatched columns
in one table. For instance, suppose we misplace some rows from our
`airlines` table: 

```{webr}
airlines_major <- airlines |>
    filter(carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA", "WN", "B6", "AS"))
```

If we inner join on `airlines_major`, we _loose_ many of the rows
in `flights`. 

```{webr}
NROW(flights)
inner_join(flights, 
           airlines_major, 
           join_by(carrier == carrier)) |>
    NROW()
```

Sometimes this is what we want, but not always. If we instead use
a left join, we keep all of the rows in `flights`: 

```{webr}
NROW(flights)
left_join(flights, 
          airlines_major, 
          join_by(carrier == carrier)) |>
    NROW()
```

Rows lacking a pair in `airlines_major` fill the missing columns with
`NA`. This fits our mental model of missing values in `R`: in theory,
these flights should have some carrier name, but given the data at hand, 
we don't know what it is. 

```{webr}
NROW(flights)
left_join(flights, 
          airlines_major, 
          join_by(carrier == carrier)) |>
    filter(carrier %in% c("MQ", "OO", "VX")) |>
    glimpse() # Look at 'name' column
```

`left_join`s are useful if we want to join two tables, but want to avoid
dropping any rows from a 'gold standard' table.


We're not going to say much about `right_join` since it's really just a flipped
`left_join`: 

```{r}
#| eval: false

left_join(x, y, join_by(name_x == name_y))

# is the same as

right_join(y, x, join_by(name_y == name_x))
```

Sometimes one form is more convenient than the other, particularly when one table
requires lots of pre-processing that you want to put earlier in the pipeline. 

## Selecting Join Types

Section 19.4 of the [`R` for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins#how-do-joins-work)
textbook provides useful visualizations of the different types of joins. We
adapt their Figures 19.2 - 19.8 here. 

Suppose we seek to join two tables, `x` and `y`: 

![](../images/r4ds_2e_join_figs/fig19_2.png)

Here, we see that that these tables have some shared rows (`1` and `2`) but some
non-shared rows (`3` in table `x` and `4` in table `y`). Ultimately, different 
joins will differ in how they treat those non-shared rows. 

To set up a join, you can _conceptually_ think of starting with all possible
pairs. For this data set, that's $9 = 3 \times 3$ total possible pairings: 

![](../images/r4ds_2e_join_figs/fig19_3.png)

You do not generally want to _actually_ make all these pairs when dealing
with large data - this is just a mental tool. 

When you add a join key (`join_by()`) you are specifying which of these possible
pairs you are possibly interested in. All joins will capture the proper matches
(`1` and `2`) - the only difference is in the treatment of unmatched pairs. 

The most restrictive join -- the `inner_join` -- only captures _true matches_: 

![](../images/r4ds_2e_join_figs/fig19_4.png)

Here the green and purple (`1` and `2`) rows have matches so we keep them. There
is no match for the orange or yellow rows so the `inner_join` discards them. 

If we want to keep the unmatched orange `3`, we might use a `left_join`: 

![](../images/r4ds_2e_join_figs/fig19_5.png)

Here you're seeing that we keep everything in the left (`x` table). We don't
have a matching row in the `y` table, but that's ok - we just fill it in with
our _missing_ value `NA`. 

The `right_join` is the exact opposite: 

![](../images/r4ds_2e_join_figs/fig19_6.png)

Here, we keep everything from the right / bottom / second table. Specifically, 
we keep the yellow `4`, but discard the orange `3`. As before, we fill in the
missing value for the `x` column with an `NA`. 

Finally, the `full_join` keeps everything: 

![](../images/r4ds_2e_join_figs/fig19_7.png)
Note importantly that this doesn't force a match for orange `3` or yellow `4`. 
They are still both unmatched, so they both wind up with `NA` values. Because
the missing data comes from different tables, we now have an `NA` in both
columns. 

If you think this all sounds like Venn diagrams and set theory, you aren't wrong:

![](../images/dplyr_joins.svg)

At this point, you are probably asking yourself _when_ you should use which type
of join. There unfortunately isn't a one-size fits all answer. For me, the choice
of join is essentially equivalent to how you want to handle missing values. 

An `inner_join` is essentially the same as automatically passing `na.rm=TRUE` to
all downstream analysis, while a `left_join` or similar will produce `NA`s you
have to deal with later. If the `NA`s are going to be relevant - *e.g.*, if you
want to report the number of unmatched values - I'd use a `left_join`, but
otherwise I find myself reaching for `inner_join` by default. 

It is sometimes worthwhile to abstract this a bit to think about _why_ your data
is missing: in statistics, we often think about three models of missingness: 

- Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
- Missing at Random (MAR)
- Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

MCAR missingness - when the missingness is truly random and unrelated to 
any variables of interst - is a strong and rare condition, but it's really the 
only situation where it's totally safe to just drop missing values. 

Dealing with missing data is a bit of an art and often easier to discuss on
concrete problems than in the abstract. *E.g*, in our `flights` data, the missing
values (`is.na(arr_delay) == TRUE`) correspond to cancelled flights. These aren't
MCAR and they are actually MNAR (the worst case): they are missing precisely because
they would have been _huge_ delays. If you simply throw them out, you are technically
reporting an accurate value, but you are obscuring a deeper underlying truth. 

::: {.callout-caution title="Extra: Going Deeper with Joins" collapse="true"}

We won't discuss them here, but there are several additional types of joins
you might use on rare occasion. I wouldn't worry about mastering them now, but
for completeness: 

- `full_join`: this essentially combines the `left_join` and `right_join` and
  never drops rows from either table, even if unmatched
- `semi_join`: this is essentially an `inner_join(x, y)` that then throws away
  the `y` columns and only keeps `x`. This is primarily useful when you are 
  checking that you have data that can be properly joined later in the analysis
  or if you have a "gold standard" table you want to be sure you are only looking
  at subsets of. 
- `anti_join`: this is the opposite of an `inner_join` or `semi_join`. 
  `anti_join(x, y)` returns the rows of `x` that don't have a match in `y`. This
  is mainly used for finding missing data. *E.g.*, I use an `anti_join` in some
  of my code to find students who haven't submitted an assignment by anti-joining 
  my list of students with the list of submissions I have received. 
- `cross_join`: the cross join is essentially the "maximal" join and it returns
  all possible combinations without doing any subsetting or filtering, *i.e.*, 
  no `join_by` statement. This is a bit dangerous to use on anything but small
  data sets since it can create many rows quickly. 
  
You can also pass more complex operations to the `join_by` operator: 

- Inequality joins: you can do something like `join_by(x >= y)`. This can be used
  to do things like cumulative operators for time series: 
  
  ```{webr}
  library(tibble)
  ts_df <- tribble(~date,       ~value, 
                   Sys.Date(),       3, 
                   Sys.Date() - 1,   2, 
                   Sys.Date() - 2,   1, 
                   Sys.Date() - 3,   0)
  dy_df <- data.frame(date = Sys.Date() - (0:3)) |>
               mutate(weekday = strftime(date, "%A"))
  left_join(ts_df, dy_df, join_by(date >= date)) |> 
     group_by(date.y) |> 
     summarize(mean(value))
  ```
  
  This is rather advanced. 
  
- In other circumstances, you won't have exact equality to match on and can do
  "nearest" joins using the `closest()` or `between()` functions.

# Additional `dplyr` functionality

`dplyr` provides some additional functionality that is often useful. While these
functions are not as important as the SQL-type verbs we've covered above, it
is worth being aware of them so that you have a starting point if these types
of questions come up in your mini-projects or course project. Unlike the 
`*_join` family, there isn't really an overarching "theory" of these
functions: they are just things that come up in data analysis. 

## Vector Functions

Most of the functions we have discussed to this point in the course are either
fully vectorized (`+`, `cos`, `sqrt`) or fully summarizing (`length`, `sum`, `min`). 
There is a third class of functions which are vector-in+vector-out but that also
need to look at the whole vector. I divide these broadly into the three 
categories below. 

### Ranking Values

Often, you will want to put "ranks" or "orders" next to values, so that you can
see what is the highest, second highest, etc. While you can get the highest or
lowest values rather easily with `min` and `max`, getting other ranks is harder.

These three functions - `row_number`, `min_rank`, and `dense_rank` - are best
illustrated by an example: 

```{r}
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
data.frame(x = c(1.5, 3, 10, 15, 10, 4)) |> 
    mutate(rn = row_number(x), 
           mn = min_rank(x), 
           dr = dense_rank(x))
```

As you can see, these differ in how they handle ties (here the two `x=10` rows): 

- `row_number` gives the lower rank to whichever row comes first
- `min_rank` gives them both the lower rank and then "skips" to make up
- `dense_rank` gives them both the lower rank, like `min_rank`, but doesn't skip
  values to account for the tie

This brings up an important element of these types of functions: they are the 
first things we have seen that are sensitive to row order! This makes them a bit
unpredictable so if you need tight quality control of outputs, it's usually a
good idea to have an `arrange` just before using them. 

In more statistical contexts, we might use percentiles instead of ranks: 

```{r}
data.frame(x = c(1.5, 3, 10, 15, 10, 4)) |> 
    mutate(pr = percent_rank(x), 
           cd = cume_dist(x))
```

Here the percentiles let us say, e.g., 60\% of other rows are below this row. The
methods differ essentially in how they treat the endpoints. 

### Cumulative (Running) Values

Particularly when dealing with temporal data, *cumulative* statistics may be useful: 

```{r}
data.frame(date = Sys.Date() - seq(7, 1), 
           value = c(1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500)) |>
    mutate(cum_mean = cummean(value), 
           cum_sum  = cumsum(value), 
           cum_max  = cummax(value), 
           cum_min  = cummin(value))
```

Clearly, this sort of cumulative value is highly sensitive to row order. 

It is also worth distinguishing *cumulative* values - which include _all_ values
up to that point - from *running* values - which only use a fixed lookback window. 
Running statistics are not included in `dplyr` and will require other packages. 

### Shift Functions

Similarly, in time series, it is useful to look at the previous or next values 
to compute things like percent change. Here the `lead` and `lag` functions may
be helpful: 

```{r}
data.frame(date = Sys.Date() - seq(7, 1), 
           value = c(1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500)) |>
    mutate(prev_value = lag(value), 
           pct_change = 100 *(value / prev_value - 1))
```

## Conditional Manipulations

As we have seen, the `mutate` command can be used to perform a transformation
to all rows. Sometimes, we only want to perform a transformation to certain rows
or to perform different transformations depending on the values of one or
more columns. In this context, things like `if_else` and `case_when` may be
useful: 


```{r}
data.frame(x = c(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)) |>
    mutate(x_pos_squared = if_else(x > 0, x^2, 0))
```

Here, the `if_else` command checks whether the condition is true (if `x` is positive):
if it is, we get the value of the first argument (`x^2`); if it is not true, we get
the second (`0`).

The `case_when` operator generalizes this to 3 or more cases: 

```{r}
data.frame(x = c(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3), 
           group=c("cos", "sin", "tan", "cos", "sin", "sin", "tan")) |>
    mutate(x_trig = case_when(
        group == "cos" ~ cos(x), 
        group == "sin" ~ sin(x), 
        group == "tan" ~ tan(x)
    ))
```

Here, the `case_when` checks the conditions in order to figure out 
which transformation to apply. The syntax is a bit funny: the expression
to the left of the `~` is the thing checked to see if it is true; the value
on the right of the `~` is the value returned. Because of this, you can set
defaults by putting a `TRUE ~` in the final case: 

```{r}
data.frame(x = c(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3), 
           group=c("cos", "sin", "unknown", "cos", "sin", "sin", "unknown")) |>
    mutate(x_trig = case_when(
        group == "cos" ~ cos(x), 
        group == "sin" ~ sin(x), 
        TRUE  ~ NA
    ))
```

Note that this is all still evaluated row-by-row independently. If you want to
do groupwise operations, you need a `group_by` and likely a `summarize` to follow. 

```{r}
penguins |>
    group_by(species) |>
    mutate(label = case_when(
        body_mass == max(body_mass, na.rm=TRUE) ~ "Biggest of Species", 
        body_mass == min(body_mass, na.rm=TRUE) ~ "Smallest of Species", 
        TRUE ~ "In the middle"
    ))
```

Here, as always, the `min` and `max` are computed groupwise, *i.e.*, per species,
because of the `group_by` that comes before. 

::: {.callout-caution title="Extra: Multi-Column Operations" collapse="true"}

We sometimes do need to put multiple columns together, *e.g.*, to get
the student's highest score on three attempts at a test. This *can* be done with
the `c_across` operator, but I honestly find it a bit confusing and prefer to
do some pivot magic: 

```{r}
student_grades <- tribble(
    ~name,    ~test1, ~test2, ~test3, 
    "Alice",      90,     80,    100,
    "Bob",        90,     90,     80,
    "Carol",      50,    100,    100,
    "Dave",      100,      0,      0)

student_grades |> 
    rowwise() |> # Make each row its own group so that we don't accidentally combine
    mutate(max_test = max(c_across(c(test1, test2, test3))), 
           avg_test = mean(c_across(c(test1, test2, test3))))
```

This is pretty fragile and a bit slow due to the `rowwise()` operator which makes
every row its own groups, so I personally find the `pivot` approach easier 
for this: 

```{r}
library(tidyr) # For pivot_longer
student_grades |>
    pivot_longer(cols=c(test1, test2, test3), 
                 names_to="test", 
                 values_to="score") |>
    group_by(name) |>
    summarize(max_test = max(score), 
              avg_test = mean(score)) 
```

But *chacun à son goût*.

## Exercises

Answer the following questions using the various techniques described above. 

1.  Identify the top 5 days by largest fraction of flights delayed. 

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Solution"}
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        group_by(year, month, day) |> 
        summarize(frac_delayed = mean(dep_delay > 0, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
        ungroup() |> 
        mutate(delayed_rank = dense_rank(desc(frac_delayed))) |>
        slice_max(frac_delayed, n=5)
    ```
    
    Note a few points of danger to be aware of here: 
    
    1. `dense_rank` and company sort in ascending order, so we need to use the
        `desc` modifier to reverse the rankings. 
    2. You have to `ungroup` after `summarize` or you will do rankings _within_
       each group (here, month), which gives incorrect values.
       
    If you want to modify your code to make the result a bit more attractive,
    this snippet has some useful tricks: 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |> 
        group_by(year, month, day) |> 
        summarize(frac_delayed = mean(dep_delay > 0, na.rm=TRUE), 
                  n_delayed = sum(dep_delay > 0, na.rm=TRUE), 
                  n_total = n()) |> 
        ungroup() |> 
        mutate(delayed_rank = dense_rank(desc(frac_delayed))) |>
        slice_max(frac_delayed, n=5) |>
        mutate(date = ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep="-")), 
               Date = strftime(date, "%B %d, %Y"), 
               `Percent Delayed` = round(frac_delayed * 100, 2), 
               `Ranking` = delayed_rank) |>
        select(Ranking, `Percent Delayed`, Date)

2.  Create a table of the daily YTD mean average departure delay for all flights 
    departing Newark airport. 
    
    *Hint*: You can first group by days and compute daily averages, then compute
    the YTD quantities or you can compute a cumulative statistic over all flights
    and then take end of day values using `last()`. These are slightly different,
    but should not differ greatly, as they essentially just vary in whether
    days are weighted by number of flights.

        ungroup() |>
        mutate(ytd_mean_dep_delay = cummean(mean_dep_delay))
    ```
    
    Second approach: 
    
    ```{webr}
    flights |>

4.  To this point, we have looked at average delay using both the positive and
    negative values in that column. This gives airlines 'credit' for flights
    that leave early, but may understate the true delays experienced by passengers.
    Create a new column measuring _real_ delays by setting negative delays (early
    departures) to zero and compute the average delay per airline.

        select(Airline, everything()) |>
