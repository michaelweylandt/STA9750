## Life Tip of the Week

Don't confuse an _explanation_ with an _excuse_

- Explanation is _neutral_: why? 
- Excuse presumes forgiveness

- I often find myself getting annoyed at various political commentators for 
  reacting  in a way I feel is not strong enough. 
  
  They are doing their job - explaining the world; dispassion is not approval.

2. more just in your treatment of others; and 
3. more understanding of the views of those whom you may disagree with
