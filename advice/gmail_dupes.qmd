### Easy Duplicate Emails with Gmail

If you have a `gmail` account, you actually have _infinite_ accounts: 

`email+tag@gmail.com` gets forwarded to `email@gmail.com`

for _any_ (reasonable) `tag`

. . . 

Use this to: 

- Track _who_ is reselling your email
- Get access to 'new account sales' / 'signup promotions' 
  (typically based on email)
- Quickly sort and organize emails
