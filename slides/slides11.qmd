## Observation Comments

> Thank you!

## Large Files

Several of you have reported issues with `git` complaining about large files

> `git ls-tree -r -t -l --full-name HEAD | sort -n -k 4 | tail -n 10`

[SO on Removing Large Files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43762338/how-to-remove-file-from-git-history#52643437):

> `git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch data/**' HEAD`

⚠️This is dangerous! I can help with it after class.⚠️

# Review: Identifying HTML Elements

# Pre-Assignment #11 FAQs

## FAQ: HTML vs CSS

> What is the difference between HTML and CSS?

HTML is _substance_; CSS is _style_ 

Distinction can be a bit blurry \& CSS can live "inside" HTML

[Example](view-source:https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini04.html)

## FAQ: `a` in SelectorGadget

> Why does [SelectorGadget] display "a" in the selector when selecting a web link?

`a` is for anchor. 

Confusingly, anchors are both links and destinations.

Anchors can reference: 

- Another page (`http://URL`)
- A particular part of another page (`http://URL#place`)
- A particular part of the same page (`#place`)

Quarto supports [cross-linking](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) with anchors

## FAQ: SelectorGadget - Multiple Clicks

> Why does SelectorGadget go "unique" when I click multiple 
  elements of interest?
  
Can't find a common structure: 

- Typically a problem within lists or common element types

## FAQ: Selectors - Nesting

> How to avoid unwanted elements such as headers or 
  sidebars, focusing only on the main content I need?
  
Nest your selectors! 

`thing1 thing2` will select only `thing2`s inside a `thing1`

[StarWars page](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html)

. . .

Try `main h2`

## FAQ: Relationship to Markdown

> Is [HTML] similar to Markdown ?

Markdown is an easier way to write (a subset of) HTML

Name is a bad joke: Markup (`M` in `HTML`) vs Markdown

HTML can (theoretically) do more, but painful to write by hand

## FAQ: Messy HTML

> How can we target data with CSS Selectors in messy HTML?

Pain and suffering - depends how messy. 

Worst case: a little bit of HTML selection + text processing (next week)

## HTML Review

- HTML Structure
- CSS Selectors (SelectorGadget)
- Introduction `rvest`

## Pre-Assignment Exercises

- [Star Wars](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html)

. . . 

`main h2`

. . . 

- [CUNY Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_City_University_of_New_York_institutions)

. . . 

`table` or `tbody`

. . . 

- [Baruch GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College)

. . . 

`.geo`

# New Material: `rvest`

## Live Demo: `rvest`


## Exercise 1: CUNY Map

Recall [Lab 1](../labs/lab01.html). Goal: extend map to all CUNYs

Steps: 

1. Read CUNY table and extract links
2. Follow links and pull coordinates
   - To read `geo` class, use this: 
```{r}
#| eval: false
COORDS <- html_element(".geo") |> html_text() |> str_split_1(";")
LAT <- as.numeric(COORDS[1])
LON <- as.numeric(COORDS[2])
```
3. Adapt Lab 1 `leaflet` to show all locations
