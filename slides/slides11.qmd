# Pre-Assignment #09 FAQs

## FAQ: HTML vs CSS

> What is the difference between HTML and CSS?

HTML is _substance_; CSS is _style_ 

Distinction can be a bit blurry \& CSS can live "inside" HTML

[Example](view-source:https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini04.html)

## FAQ: `a` in SelectorGadget

> Why does [SelectorGadget] display "a" in the selector when selecting a web link?

`a` is for anchor. 

Confusingly, anchors are both links and destinations.

Anchors can reference: 

- Another page (`http://URL`)
- A particular part of another page (`http://URL#place`)
- A particular part of the same page (`#place`)

Quarto supports [cross-linking](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) with anchors

## FAQ: SelectorGadget - Multiple Clicks

> Why does SelectorGadget go "unique" when I click multiple 
  elements of interest?
  
Can't find a common structure: 

- Typically a problem within lists or common element types

## FAQ: Selectors - Nesting

> How to avoid unwanted elements such as headers or 
  sidebars, focusing only on the main content I need?
  
Nest your selectors! 

`thing1 thing2` will select only `thing2`s inside a `thing1`

[StarWars page](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html)

. . .

Try `main h2`

## FAQ: Relationship to Markdown

> Is [HTML] similar to Markdown ?

Markdown is an easier way to write (a subset of) HTML

Name is a bad joke: Markup (`M` in `HTML`) vs Markdown

HTML can (theoretically) do more, but painful to write by hand

## FAQ: Messy HTML

> How can we target data with CSS Selectors in messy HTML?

Pain and suffering - depends how messy. 

Worst case: a little bit of HTML selection + text processing (next week)

# Peer Advice

## Selected Peer Advice: 

- More effort into writing, motivation, and formatting (several)
- Be sure to push image files in addition to `qmd`
- Code-folding!
- Learning style for more experienced peers
- More charts
- `setNames` to improve table formatting. (MW: I prefer `rename` YMMV)
- Table of contents
- Be selective in outputs

## My Advice

- Most effort $\neq$ most important 
- Reader _knows less_ and _cares less_ than you think
- Summary / Abstract goes a long way
- Cross-linking useful

- Use suggested file names

- "What have you tried?"
- Help me help you

- Print less

# Today

## Agenda

- Review of HTML / CSS Structure
- Pre-Assignment Examples
  - Star Wars
  - CUNY Table
  - Baruch GPS
- Exercise
  - CUNY Map
  - Cocktails (Part 1)
  
## HTML Review

- HTML Structure
- CSS Selectors (SelectorGadget)
- Introduction `rvest`

## Pre-Assignment Exercises

- [Star Wars](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html)

. . . 

`main h2`

. . . 

- [CUNY Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_City_University_of_New_York_institutions)

. . . 

`table` or `tbody`

. . . 

- [Baruch GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College)

. . . 

`.geo`

## Exercise 1: CUNY Map

Recall [Lab 1](../labs/lab01.html). Goal: extend map to all CUNYs

Steps: 

1. Read CUNY table and extract links
2. Follow links and pull coordinates
   - To read `geo` class, use this: 
```{r}
#| eval: false
COORDS <- html_element(".geo") |> html_text() |> str_split_1(";")
LAT <- as.numeric(COORDS[1])
LON <- as.numeric(COORDS[2])
```
3. Adapt Lab 1 `leaflet` to show all locations

## Exercise 2: Cocktails

Goal: create a cocktail _data frame_ from [Hadley's Recipies](https://cocktails.hadley.nz/)

Today: 
- How to find them all? 
- How to extract individual recepies? 
- How to pull items from each recipie? 

Next time:

- Data wrangling
