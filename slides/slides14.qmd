## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects

- Congratulations! Done with all Mini-Projects!

**Fantastic** work this semester!

## Week 13 Pre-Assignment

- Reflection on course: 
  - How far have you come?
  - What have you learned? 
  - What was helpful? What was unhelpful? 
  
Thank you for your comments!

## Grading

Returned:

- Mid-Term Check-In Feedback
- MP#03 Grades

We owe you:

- MP#04 Grades

## Final Report - Group

*Non-Technical* Presentation - Think of yourself as a "consultant" asked by a client to investigate a topic.

## Final Report - Individual

*Technical* Appendix to Group Report. Still requires writing,
context, *etc.* but this is in particular where I'm going to
look at your code. 

## Final Project Reports

Group **and** Individual Reports 

- Submitted via GitHub **and** Brightspace

Deadline extended to the day of the 'final', December 19th


**No late work accepted** (I have to submit grades!)

## Peer Assessment

On Brightspace, I have opened an additional quiz for *peer evaluation* 
of your teammates. 

- 8 questions: scale of 1 (bad) to 3 (great)

Please submit a copy for *each* of your teammates. 

- Brightspace set to allow multiple submissions.
- Due on same day as reports

. . .

If you don't submit these, **you** will receive a 0 for 
your peer evaluations

**No late work accepted** (I have to submit grades!)

## Final Project Grading

Rubric is set _high_ to give me flexibility to reward teams
that take on big challenges

Hard rubric => Grades are curved generously 

. . . 

Multiple paths to success 

If your problem is "easy" on an element (data import
in particular), that's great! Don't spend the effort 
over-complicating things. Effort is better spent elsewhere
