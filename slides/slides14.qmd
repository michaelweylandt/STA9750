## Course Project

End of Semester Course Project: 

::: {.incremental .smaller}

- In-Class Final Presentations
  - Today! [Or during finals week for a few teams]
- Individual Report
  - **`r get_project_due_date("individual_report")`**
- Group Report
  - **`r get_project_due_date("group_report")`**
- Peer Evaluations
  - **`r get_project_due_date("peer_evaluation")`**

:::

See [detailed instructions](../project.html) for rubrics, expectations, *etc.*

## Final Report - Group

*Non-Technical* Summary 

> Think of yourself as a "consultant" asked by a client to investigate a topic. 
> This is the "Executive Summary" - details in appendix (individual reports)

. . . 

Should cover roughly the same material as presentation

::: {.smaller}

- Can link to individual reports for details
- Use image links `![]()` to reference figures from individual reports 
- "Words and pictures" not "code"

:::

. . . 

Only one of you needs to submit on Brightspace. Everyone should still 
open a GH issue

## Final Report - Individual

*Technical* Appendix to Group Report. 

> Appendix for lower-level (detail-oriented) staff, not leadership

**Still requires writing and context**, *etc.* but this is
in particular where I'm going to look at your code and analysis. 

**Good Thinking** is more important than **Good Findings**

. . . 


::: {.small}

*I* am your audience, so don't waste time explaining basic technical details.
I'm more interested in you justifying the choices you made along the way

:::

. . . 

::: {.small}

Code does not count towards word counts. (See [helper function for word count](../tips.html#count_words))

:::

## Final Reports

Group **and** Individual Reports 

- Submitted via GitHub **and** Brightspace
- Everyone submit a separate link to group report on GH

Deadline on "final exam" day

. . . 

**No late work accepted** (I have to submit grades before family arrives!)

## Project Peer Feedback

New peer feeback mechanism (feedback welcome!)

- You have 100 points *to allocate to teammates*

Can't assign points to yourself

. . . 

**Additionally**,  8 optional qualitative questions (Brightspace) for *peer evaluation* 

Submit a copy for *each* teammate - I will anonymize to give advice

- Due on same day as reports

. . . 

If you don't submit, you won't receive any points

## Final Project Grading

Rubric is set _high_ to give me flexibility to reward teams
that take on big challenges

Hard rubric => Grades are curved generously 

. . . 

Multiple paths to success 

If your project is "easy" on an element (data import
in particular), that's great! Don't spend the effort 
over-complicating things. Effort is better spent elsewhere

# End of Semester Reflections

## Instructor's Reflection 

## Course Feedback

Reflection on course: 

  - How far have you come?
  - What have you learned? 
  - What was helpful? What was unhelpful? 
  
> [My (anonymous) feedback survey](https://baruch.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9uyZ4YFsrcRRPIG)

This is *in addition* to the Baruch central course assesments. 

## Course Feedback

Used to improve future course offerings. Previous changes:

::: {.small}

- Added a second round of project feedback
  - Help students "scope" projects suitably
- More _applied analytics_ than _programming exercises_ in HW
  - Other programming resources already online; 
  - Many students have prior experience (Python, SQL)
  - More interest in *Analytics* than Software Engineering
- Added GitHub and Portfolio Construction
  - Give students *evidence of skills* to share with employers
  
:::

## Course Feedback

Plans for next semester: 

::: {.small .incremental}

- Make MPs Best 3 of 4 (auto-drop one)
  - Details TBD; h/t @HV for suggestion
- Add technical Qs to pre-assignments
  - Allow unlimited retries
- Move MP deadlines a bit earlier to give more time for final presentations
- Require team check-ins earlier in semester 
- Make 'work plan' and conflict plan _mandatory_

:::

Other thoughts welcome!

## Advice

Use the break well!

- Finish the semester strong
- Take a well-deserved break
- Come back in a month or or so
  - Consolidate and refresh skills
  - "Spaced Repetition" to 'lock in' new skills
  - Old Mini-Projects for additional practice
  
Don't let all your effort go to waste!
