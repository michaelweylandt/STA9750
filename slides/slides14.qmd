# Course Projects

## Final Report - Group

*Non-Technical* Presentation 

> Think of yourself as a "consultant" asked by a client to investigate a topic. This is the "Executive Summary" - details in appendix (individual reports)

## Final Report - Individual

*Technical* Appendix to Group Report. 

> Appendix for lower-level (detail-oriented) staff, not leadership

Still requires writing, context, *etc.* but this is
in particular where I'm going to look at your code and analysis. 

**Good Thinking** is more important than **Good Findings**

## Final Project Reports

Group **and** Individual Reports 

- Submitted via GitHub **and** Brightspace

Deadline on the day of the semester (**`r read_csv("key_dates.csv") |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Summary Report")) |> pull(Date)`**)

**No late work accepted** (I have to submit grades!)

## Peer Assessment

New peer feeback mechanism (feedback welcome!)

- You have 100 points *to allocate to teammates*

Can't assign points to yourself

. . . 

**Additionally**,  8 optional qualitative questions (Brightspace) for *peer evaluation* 

Submit a copy for *each* teammate - I will anonymize to give advice

- Due on same day as reports (**`r read_csv("key_dates.csv") |> filter(str_detect(Details, "Summary Report")) |> pull(Date)`**)

. . . 

If you don't submit, you won't receive any points

## Final Project Grading

Rubric is set _high_ to give me flexibility to reward teams
that take on big challenges

Hard rubric => Grades are curved generously 

. . . 

Multiple paths to success 

If your problem is "easy" on an element (data import
in particular), that's great! Don't spend the effort 
over-complicating things. Effort is better spent elsewhere

# End of Semester Reflections

## Instructor's Reflection


## Course Feedback

Reflection on course: 

  - How far have you come?
  - What have you learned? 
  - What was helpful? What was unhelpful? 
  
> [My (anonymous) feedback survey](https://baruch.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9uyZ4YFsrcRRPIG)

This is *in addition* to the Baruch central course assesments. 

## Course Feedback

Used to improve future course offerings. Previous changes:

- Added a second round of project feedback
  - Help students "scope" projects suitably
- More _applied analytics_ than _programming exercises_ in HW
  - Other programming resources already online; 
  - Many students have prior experience (Python, SQL)
  - More interest in *Analytics* than Software Engineering
- Added GitHub and Portfolio Construction
  - Give students *evidence of skills* to share with employers

## Course Feedback

Plans for future improvement: 

- (Slightly) limit scope of MPs
- Extra Credit for in-class engagement
- Move MP deadlines a bit earlier to give more time for final presentations

Other thoughts welcome!

## Hall of Fame 

Submit [Hall of Fame Nominations](https://baruch.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9Yb1mzdI4WuzjM2)

## Baruch Course Evaluations

**Short Break** to complete course evaluations

[http://baruch.cuny.edu/EVALS](http://baruch.cuny.edu/EVALS)

Roughly: 

- Scores used by central administration
- Comments used by faculty and departments to improve offerings

## Advice

Use the break well!

- Finish the semester strong
- Take a well-deserved break
- Come back in a month or or so
  - Consolidate and refresh skills
  - "Spaced Repetition" to 'lock in' new skills
  - Old Mini-Projects (previous semesters)?
  
Don't let all your effort go to waste!


## Farewell, but Hopefully Not Goodbye!

If you're staying at Baruch: 

- Visit my Office Hours anytime
- Take these skills and use them to excel in future classes
- Continue to develop your professional presence 

. . . 

If you're graduating: 

- Congratulations!
- Always Available by Email


# 🎊🥳🎉 \n Congratulations!!
