## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Project #03

Now [online](https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini03.html)

**Due `r get_mp_deadline(03)`**

- GitHub post (used for peer feedback) AND Brightspace
- Three Weeks: don't wait until the very end

- Should be less demanding than MP #01 and MP#02
  - Lots of little files. **No big files!**
  - Maps and election retrodiction
  
. . .

Pay attention to [the rubric](../miniprojects/mini03.html#rubric)


## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Project #03

Tips: 

- `geom_sf` by default puts a thin grey boundary around each `geometry`. 
   Disable this by using `geom_sf(color=NA)`. 

- You can plot a state in a certain color by plotting all of its districts
  in that same color. Alternatively, use `st_combine` to combine `geometries`.
  
- Each state gets $R+2$ ECVs where $R$ is the number of congressional districts
  in that state. 
  
- `st_simplify` can "smooth out" boundaries to make things easier to plot
