## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Project #01

üëè Thank you to everyone who took part in peer feedback! üëè

I will start processing grades and uploading to Brightspace soon. 
(Moving day for me...)

. . .

I've started reading some submissions - really excellent work! 

- Plots (exciting!), sophisticated and insightful analyses, creative policymaking

. . . 

Hopefully automated checks and personalized emails helpful (new this year)

If you have ideas for other useful automated 'supports' let me know

## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Project #01

Some popular tips:

- The [`kable`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html) function
  makes nice tables
- The [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/) package makes very nice tables
- `Quarto` allows "code folding": useful for hiding long boring code blocks

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
1 + 1
```

You can set this globally. You also want to keep `echo: true`.

## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Project #02

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

    mp_file <- glue("miniprojects/mini0{N}.qmd")

    header_end <- which(grepl("---", mp_text))[2]
    
    header_info <- yaml.load(readLines(mp_file, n=header_end))
    
    header_info$mp_title %||% "TBD"

               `Item Number`== N,

               !str_detect(Details, "Peer")) |>
        mutate(due = paste(Date, "at", Time)) |>
        pull(due)
}


get_pa_deadline <- function(N){
    read_csv("key_dates.csv") |> 
        filter(`Course Element` == "Pre-Assignments", 
               `Item Number`== N, 
               str_detect(Details, "Due"), 
               !str_detect(Details, "Peer")) |>

[MP#02 in process now](../miniprojcts/mini02.html) - `r get_mp_title(2)`

. . .

**Due `r get_mp_deadline(2)`**

-   GitHub post (used for peer feedback) AND Brightspace

. . .

Pay attention to [the rubric](../miniprojects/mini02.html#rubric)

-   Writing and presentation are about 50% of your grade
-   Evaluated on *rigor* and *thoughtfulness*
-   Use what you learned from MP #01

## Upcoming Mini-Projects

Topics

-   MP#03: `r get_mp_title(3)`
-   MP#04: `r get_mp_title(4)`

## Pre-Assignments

Brightspace - Wednesdays at 11:45

- Reading, typically on course website
- Brightspace auto-grades
  - I have to manually change to completion grading

Next pre-assignment is **`r get_pa_deadline(7)`**

. . . 

I missed a few comments in the previous cycle (sorry!) - trying to catch up 
in the next few days

## Course Support

- Synchronous
  - Office Hours 2x / week
- Asynchronous
  - Piazza ($<30$ minute average response time)

## Upcoming Week

Due Wednesday at 11:45pm:

- Pre-Assignment #07 (Brightspace)
  * Introduction to plotting with `ggplot2`

Expect back:

-   MP#01 consolidated grades
-   Project proposal instructor feedback

## Project Proposal Presentations

[Official Description](https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/project.html#project-proposal-presentations)

- **6 minute presentation**
- Key topics:
  - *Animating Question*
  - *Team Roster*
- Also discuss: Possible specific questions, data sources, 
  analytical plan, anticipated challenges

. . . 

Most important: team names! 

Last semester: Rat Pack, Subway Surfers, Going for Gold, EVengers, *etc.*

## After Proposals

100% optional discussion of `dplyr` vs `SQL`

- `SQL` is a very common Data Scientist interview topic so if you're not taking
  a database course, might be useful
