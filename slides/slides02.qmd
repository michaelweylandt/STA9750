## Piazza 

- 11 sign-ups: 17 still need to sign up
- Thank you for those of you who already posted questions!
- Post #05 - Search for Teammates

> *Instructor Tip: Before committing a team with someone, you can
  look up their GitHub and see how they did on MP#00 and MP#01.
  This might be helpful to find teammates whose standards are
  calibrated to your own.*
  
Special thanks to JLL for finding and reporting issues 
with MP#00 instructions

## Pre-Assignments {.smaller}

Pre-Assignment 02:

  - 20 / 28 submitted 
  - Ignore Brightspace's Grading
    - Brightspace automatically marks all short answers as wrong
    - Look at "Grades" tab to see actual sub-totals
      (12.5 / 100 = 1/8 = full credit on 1 of 8 graded PAs)
  - I will often give feedback through Brightspace, so make
    sure to go back and see if I've left you any comments. 
    (I might not give comments on every question though.)

. . .
  
Pre-Assignment 03:

  - Before midnight nextweek : 
  - Available on course website + Brightspace after 9pm

# FAQs from PA#02

## Q1

> What is Markdown? 

Per Wikipedia: "Markdown is a light-weight, plain-text, 
markup language specification"

:::: {.incremental}
- Light-weight: relatively simple, focus on content than formatting
- Plain-text: accessible using almost any text editor (RStudio, GitHub, VS Code, *etc*)
  - Not locked into specific software (*e.g.*, MS Word)
  - Easily incorporated into a variety of technologies
::::


## Q1

> What is Markdown? 

:::: {.incremental}
- Markup language: a 'mini-coding language' for text documents
  - Other famous examples: HTML, XML
- Specification:
  - [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) defines 'standard' Markdown
  - Some software allows _extensions_
  - [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) often powers under the hood
::::

## Q2

> Other than text formatting, does Markdown ha[ve] 
  any other us[]es?

On its own, Markdown is just text formatting (but that's a lot!)

. . .

We will use _Quarto_ which augments markdown for 
_reproducible research_. We can embed code-*and its 
output*-inside Markdown documents.

## Q3 

> [W]hat documents use[] Markdown? 

So much! Markdown is used by Bitbucket, GitHub, OpenStreetMap,
Reddit, Stack Exchange, Drupal, ChatGPT, Discord, MS Teams 
and many more!

. . .

With tools like Pandoc/Quarto, Markdown can be _rendered_ to:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- HTML
- PDF
- Web Slides
- EBooks

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Research Papers
- Word Documents
- PowerPoint slides
- and so much more!
:::

:::: 

## Q4 

> [What is] the difference between [a] Code section and [a] Nested List[? A]re they just different ways of indenting?

No. Nested lists are 'just' text

Code formatting enables much more if rendering engine supports it:

. . .


```{.python code-line-numbers="6-8"}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Q5

> [H]ow are we going to use Markdown?

All written work (mini-projects and final project) 
in this course will be submitted using Markdown (by way of
[Quarto](https://quarto.org)). 

. . .

Specifically:

- Submission pages for 5 mini-projects
- Individual reports for course project
- Summary (team) report for final project

You are also encouraged (but not required) to use Markdown for
presentation slides (like these!)

## Q6

> How can I create Tables in Markdown? 

Markdown has two table syntaxes:

- an easy one with minimal control
- a hard one which allows fine grained control (alignment, 
  column widths, etc.) - "pipe tables"
  
If you are making complex tables, I recommend using the 
[list-table](https://github.com/pandoc-ext/list-table) extension. 

(See [`syllabus.qmd`]({{< var course.repo-url >}}/blob/main/syllabus.qmd) in course repo for examples.) 

## Q7

> How to create images and links? 

Basic hyperlinks look like this: 

```
[link text](https://the.url/goes/here)
```

. . .

If you want to _embed_ the contents of a link, prepend it with an exclamation point. This is most useful for _images_:

```
![Image Caption](https://the.url/goes/here.png)
```

. . .


You can even put a link inside an image to be fancy: 

```
[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)
```

## Q7

> How to create images and links? 

Quarto automatically embeds the results of plotting code: 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#| fig-align: "center"
plot(1:5, main="Behold, a Plot!", col=2:6, cex=5, 
     pch=16, xlab="", cex.main=5)
```

Here, Quarto handles all the file creation and link targeting for
us. If I change the code, the figure will change automatically.

# Markdown and Quarto

## Markdown and Quarto

- Quarto _implements_ Markdown with data-analytic extensions
- Seamless (ideally!) integration of code and text
- No more copy and paste

[Quarto user guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide) is fantastic!

See also [source for course materials](https://github.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750).

## Lab Activity: Part 0

If you haven't already, [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

## Lab Activity: Part 1

Create a simple PDF quarto document using the RStudio wizard. 

(Note that you may need to install `tinytex` for this to work properly, but Quarto should install it for you automatically.)

## Lab Activity: Part 2

Create a 5 slide presentation showing the Houston housing market. This should include: 

- A title slide
- Three body slides with a figure and some text
- A conclusion slide

You may use the following code snippets: 

--- 

```
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
txhousing |> filter(city=="Houston") |> 
             group_by(year) |> 
             summarize(sales=sum(sales)) |> 
             ggplot(aes(x=year, y=sales)) + 
                geom_line() + 
                ggtitle("Annual Houses Sold in Houston, TX")
```

Recall that this code needs to be between three backticks on each end (and start with `r` in curly braces as well.) 

--- 

```
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
txhousing |> filter(city=="Houston") |> 
    group_by(month) |> 
    summarize(avg_price=sum(volume) / sum(sales)) |> 
    mutate(month=factor(month.abb[month], 
                 levels=month.abb, ordered=TRUE)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x=month, y=avg_price)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
    ggtitle("Average Price of Houses Sold in Texas by Month") + 
    xlab("Month") + 
    ylab("Average Sale Price") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)
```

Recall that this code needs to be between three backticks on each end (and start with `r` in curly braces as well.) 

---

```
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
txhousing |> filter(year==2015) |> 
    group_by(city) |> 
    summarize(avg_price=sum(volume) / sum(sales),
              num_sales=sum(sales)) |> 
    slice_max(num_sales, n=10) |>
    ggplot(aes(x=city, y=avg_price)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
    ggtitle("Average Price of Houses Sold in 2015 by City in Texas") + 
    xlab("City") + 
    ylab("Average Sale Price") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)
```

Recall that this code needs to be between three backticks on each end (and start with `r` in curly braces as well.) 

## Lab Activity: Part 3

View the [Quarto Demo Slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/demo/#/title-slide) and add one new element to your slides from the previous section. 

# GitHub Pages

## GitHub Pages

In-class discussion of what a static web page is and the role of GitHub Pages as a static web server. 

# How to Ask for Help

## How to Ask for Help

Professional programming is at least half _looking things up_; 
at beginning stages, the fraction is even higher. 

So it's important to know how to see help _the smart way_:

1. Official documentation. Free software almost never becomes
   famous without great documentation: `R` and its packages
   are no exception. Everything we will use in this class has
   solid documentation. 

- [Tidyverse.org](https://tidyverse.org)

--- 

2. Search Engine. 

Most programming challenges have been faced by somebody 
before, so Google it!

Tips: 

- Include `R` or `rstats` in your search query
- It's better to search _what you want to do_ rather 
  than _how you think you should do it_.
- Search programming Q&A sites like `StackOverflow` for specific
  code questions; blogs and course materials are better for "big
  picture" questions

--- 

3. Ask on a Forum with a Reproducible Example

Programming fora, like `StackOverflow`, are full of great
resources. Most of what you need is already there. But if
you need to ask a new question, make sure to create a [_minimal reproducible example_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/16532098)

Make it easy for your helper to help you. 

- Minimal: narrow down to as few lines of code as possible
- Reproducible: self-contained without dependencies on libraries
  (if can be avoided); load all packages needed; use standard data

*Pro-Tip*: You'll solve over 50% of your problems in
trying to create an MRE.

---

Tips: 

- Show the code, even if it doesn't work
- Send code as text, not screenshot (so your helper can run it)
- Smaller examples help narrow down problems
- Avoid IO (file input and output) unless specifically 
  relevant to problem
- Remove everything you can

The _reprex_ `R` package helps with this: see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gqksthQ0cM).
