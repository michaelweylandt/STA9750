## Warm-Up

Data can be found at [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/refs/heads/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/refs/heads/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv)

Read into `R` (`readr::read_csv`) and make 3 plots: 

- Do people like more sugary candy?
- Do people like more expensive candy?
- Open-Ended

## Getting Data into `R`

Two topics: 

- How internet data transfer actually works
- How to handle non-rectangular data formats

🎃*End a bit early for Halloween*🎃

## URLs

From `abstrax.io`

![](https://abstrax.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/parts-of-url-1024x335.png)

## JSON

`JSON`:

- Short for `JavaScript Object Notation`
- Popular plain-text representation for hierarchical data. 
- Closer to Python objects (`dict`s of `dict`s of `dict`s) than `R` `data.frame`s
- *Widely* used for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

## JSON

Example: 

```
{
    "data": {
        "id": 27992,
        "title": "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884",
        "image_id": "1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33"
    },
    "config": {
        "iiif_url": "https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2",
    }
}
```

## JSON

Read JSON in `R` with `jsonlite` package (alternatives exist)

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
# A JSON array of primitives
json <- '["Mario", "Peach", null, "Bowser"]'

# Simplifies into an atomic vector
fromJSON(json)
```

## JSON

```{r}
json <-
'[
  {"Name" : "Mario", "Age" : 32, "Occupation" : "Plumber"}, 
  {"Name" : "Peach", "Age" : 21, "Occupation" : "Princess"},
  {},
  {"Name" : "Bowser", "Occupation" : "Koopa"}
]'
mydf <- fromJSON(json)
mydf
```

## JSON

```{r}
fromJSON("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York")[1:5]
```

Compare to [browser access](http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York)

## Data Transfer: `download.file`

```{r}
args(download.file)
```

Basic file download capabilities: 

- `url`: source
- `destfile`: where on your computer to store it
- `method`: what software to use in the background to download

## Data Transfer: HTTP

HTTP

- HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Most common (but not only) internet protocol
- Also `ftp`, `smtp`, `ssh`, ... 

"Low-level" mechanism of internet transfer

- Many `R` packages add a friendly UX
- `httr2` for low-level work (today)

## HTTP

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>


HTTP has two stages: 

::: {.container}

:::: {.col}

- Request
  - URL (Host + Path)
  - Method (VERB)
  - Headers
  - Content
  - Cookies
::::

:::: {.col}
- Response
  - Status Code
  - Headers
  - Content
  
::::

:::
  
Modern (easy) APIs put _most_ of the behavior in the URL

## HTTP in the Browser

In Firefox: Right-Click + `Inspect`

In Chrome: Right-Click + `Developer Tools`

## HTTP with `httr2`

`httr2` (pronounced "hitter-2") is *low-level* manipulation of
HTTP. 

```{r}
library(httr2)
request(example_url())
```

Pretty simple so far: 

- `example_url()` starts a tiny local web host
- `127.0.0.1` is `localhost`

**Live Demo Time** 

## `httr2` Requests

Build a request: 

- `req_method`
- `req_body_*`
- `req_cookies_set`
- `req_auth_basic` / `req_oauth`

Behaviors: 

- `req_cache`
- `req_timeout`

Execution: 

- `req_perform`

## `httr2` Responses

Request status

- `resp_status` / `resp_status_desc`

Content: 
- `resp_header*`
- `resp_body_*`
