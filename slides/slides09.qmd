## Course Project

[Course Project](../project.html) should be your *main focus* 
for rest of course

- But you still need to do mini-projects and pre-assignments(!)

## Mid-Semester Check-Ins

Week #10 - Mid-Semester Check-In Presentations: 

::: {.incremental}

- Overarching Question
- Data Sources
  - Quality
  - Suitability
- Specific Questions
- Prior Art
- Challenges

:::

## Data Sources

When using 'found' data, two important questions to ask: 

::: {.incremental}

- _Quality_: Does the data do what it claims to?
  - Exhaustiveness, sampling error, sampling bias, missingness
- _Suitability_: Does the data do what you need it to?
  - Right 'unit of analysis', construct alignment

:::

## Prior Art

Context and Novelty: 

::: {.incremental}

- What else have people said on your topic? 
  - What is missing? 
- What do you have to add to this conversation? (Novelty)
  - New data set, new way of measuring, new style of analysis
  
:::

. . . 

A _research_ project is not just summarization of other work: 
how can you contribute something new?

## Project Advice

General Advice:

::: {.incremental}

- Work on _as small a scale as possible_
- Leave room to _demonstrate your coding skill_: if you can't  
  demonstrate the skills of this class, your SQ may be too small
- Plan how to _integrate_ your findings: if you find 5 factors 
  are all correlated with response, how can you identify which ones
  are most important? 

:::

## Project Advice

I'll try to write up some informal advice on: 

- Estimating _causal_ effects
- Identifying key factors

# Review Exercise

## Flat / Plain Text Files

'Plain text' files:

::: {.incremental}

- Simple _human readable_ and _human writeable_ file formats
- Not specific to one piece of software
- Examples: CSV, txt, TSV
- Anti-Examples: docx, pdf, jpg

:::

. . . 

Read into `R` with `readr` functions (*e.g.*, `read_csv`)

## Best Halloween Candy

From [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/)

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjT35R8CC9Q width=1000 height=600 >}}

## Best Halloween Candy

Data can be found at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/refs/heads/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv>

Read into `R` (`readr::read_csv`) and make 3 plots: 

- Do people prefer more sugary candies? (Think OLS)
- Do people prefer more expensive candies? (Think OLS)
- Do people prefer chocolate candies? (Think ANOVA)

# Files and the File System

## Files and the File System

The _file system_ is the way your computer organizes and provides access to files: 

::: {.incremental}

- Tree like-structure: 
  - Files in folders in folders in folders ... 
    - Separated by `/`
    - *e.g.* `STA9750-2025-FALL/data/mp01/data_file.csv`
  - End point (or starting point) is the _root_: 
    - Called `/` on Mac/Linux
    - Drive name on Windows (`C:/`)
  
:::

## Home Directory

Typically, all user files are stored in a "home directory": 

::: {.incremental}

- `/Users/YOURNAME` on Mac/Linux
- `C:/Users/YOURNAME` on Windows
- Subfolders include `Downloads`, `Desktop`, `Documents`, *etc*
- Commonly abbreviated as `~`
  - My desktop is `~/Desktop`
  - My course material is in `~/{{< var course.repo >}}`
  
:::

## Paths

Two ways to specify a file: 

::: {.incremental .smaller}

- Absolute path:
  - Starts from root and gives "full name"
  - `/Users/michaelweylandt/STA9750/docs/index.html`
  - GPS coordinates
- Relative path: 
  - Starts from _working directory_ (`getwd()`) and gives directions
  - If I am in `STA9750`, path is just `docs/index.html`
  - `./`  means "this directory": could also write `./docs/index.html`
  - `../` means "up one level"
    - If I were in `STA9750/docs`, source at `../index.qmd`
  - Driving directions
  
:::

## Using the File System in R

Use the `fs` package to interact with the file system: 

::: {.incremental}

- `dir_ls()`, `dir_create()`, `dir_exists()`, `dir_delete()`
- `path()`, `path_home()`, `path_abs()`, `path_rel()`
- `file_create()`, `file_exists()`, `file_delete()`, `file_info()`

:::

## Activity #01

Return to breakout rooms to practice file system usage: 

- Convert relative paths to absolute paths
- List files in a directory
- Examine metadata the largest file(s) in your `{{< var course.repo >}}`
  directory

# Accessing Data from the Web: URLs, HTTP, JSON

## URLs

URLs are an extension of file paths for the internet: 

::: {.incremental}

- Protocol / Scheme: _How_ data should be transferred
  - HTTP(S), SMS (Texting), POP3/IMAP (Email)
- Domain: Name of the other computer
  - In practice, often a 'placeholder' for something more complex
- Path: Files on the other computer
  - In practice, hide functionalty behind file-like paths
  
:::

## URLs

From `abstrax.io`

![](https://abstrax.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/parts-of-url-1024x335.png)


## Static Data Transfer

`R`'s basic `download.file` can be used for downloading simple files:

::: {.small}

```{r}
args(download.file)
```

:::

Basic file download capabilities: 

- `url`: source
- `destfile`: where on your computer to store it

. . .

::: {.smallest}

Customizable behavior, but defaults often work well: 

- `method`: what software to use in the background to download
- `mode`: is this a text or binary file
- `cacheOK`: are you ok with a cached version of the file
- `headers`: do you need to send any additional info in your request

:::

## download.file()

```{r}
#| eval: false
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750/refs/heads/main/births.csv", 
              destfile="births.csv")
```

Note use of _relative_ path here, so saves in current working directory

. . . 

Be polite: 

- Try to avoid unnecessarily downloading files
- Save file and only download if `!file_exists(destfile)`

## Data Transfer - download.file()

```{r}
#| eval: false
if(!file_exists("births.csv")){
    download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750/refs/heads/main/births.csv", 
                  destfile="births.csv")
}

read_csv("births.csv")
```

## JSON

`JSON`:

- Short for `JavaScript Object Notation`
- Popular plain-text representation for hierarchical data. 
- Closer to Python objects (`dict`s of `dict`s of `dict`s) than `R` `data.frame`s
- *Widely* used for web-based data transfer

## JSON

Example: 

```
{
    "data": {
        "id": 27992,
        "title": "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884",
        "image_id": "1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33"
    },
    "config": {
        "iiif_url": "https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2",
    }
}
```

## JSON

Read JSON in `R` with `jsonlite` package (alternatives exist)

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
# A JSON array of primitives
json <- '["Mario", "Peach", null, "Bowser"]'

# Simplifies into an atomic vector
fromJSON(json)
```

## JSON

```{r}
json <-
'[
  {"Name" : "Mario", "Age" : 32, "Occupation" : "Plumber"}, 
  {"Name" : "Peach", "Age" : 21, "Occupation" : "Princess"},
  {},
  {"Name" : "Bowser", "Occupation" : "Koopa"}
]'
mydf <- fromJSON(json)
mydf
```

## JSON - A Web Standard

```{r}
#| cache: true
fromJSON("https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke")
```

Compare to [browser access](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke)

## Data Transfer: HTTP

HTTP

- HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Most common (but not only) internet protocol
- Also `ftp`, `smtp`, `ssh`, ... 

"Low-level" mechanism of internet transfer

- Many `R` packages add a friendly UX
- `httr2` for low-level work (today)

## HTTP

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>


HTTP has two stages: 

::: {.container}

:::: {.col}

- Request
  - URL (Host + Path)
  - Method (VERB)
  - Headers
  - Content
  - Cookies
::::

:::: {.col}
- Response
  - Status Code
  - Headers
  - Content
  
::::

:::
  
Modern (easy) APIs put _most_ of the behavior in the URL

## HTTP in the Browser

In Firefox: Right-Click + `Inspect`

In Chrome: Right-Click + `Developer Tools`

. . . 

[Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Docs for HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)

## HTTP with httr2

`httr2` (pronounced "hitter-2") is *low-level* manipulation of
HTTP. 

```{r}
library(httr2)
request(example_url())
```

Pretty simple so far: 

- `example_url()` starts a tiny local web host
- `127.0.0.1` is `localhost`

## httr2 Requests

Build a request: 

- `request`
- `req_method`
- `req_body_*`
- `req_cookies_set`
- `req_auth_basic` / `req_oauth`

## `httr2` Requests

Behaviors: 

- `req_cache`
- `req_timeout`

. . . 

Execution: 

- `req_perform`

## `httr2` Responses

Request status

- `resp_status` / `resp_status_desc`

Content: 

- `resp_header*`
- `resp_body_*`

## Live Demo

Demo: Using `httr2` to get a random joke from 

[https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/)
